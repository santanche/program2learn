"CASE 1

A liquor dealer, 47 years old, is seen December 15, 1904. His 
father died at 67 of ""obstruction of the bowels,"" hia mother at 63 of 
pDeumonia. He regularly used whiskey and beer to excess up to 1891 
when he had an attack of bloody vomiting after a debauch. He had a 
similar attack in 1895 and again in 1902. He never was kept in bed 
more than a few days, and always returned to business within a week. 
After each attack he gave up all alcohol for periods varying from six 
months to two years and then relapsed into his former habits. He 
has suffered for years from digestive disturbances, ""sour stomach,"" 
which have beeu much worse during his periods of alcoholism. After 
twenty months of abstinence he began to drink about three months 
ago, and since then has complained of anorexia, pain, eructation of 
gas, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is located in the epigastrium, 
comes on ten to fifteen minutes after eating and is relieved by vomiting. 
On the afternoon of December 11 he vomited a small quantity of bright 
red blood, and since then he has vomited after nearly every meal, 
but he has noticed blood only on one other occasion, two days ago, 
when he threw up nearly a pint. He has noticed black stools for 
several day^. He has recently lost about 15 lbs. ; present weight 185. 
Mucous membranes pale. Heart normal in size, action regular, soft 
systolic murmur at apex, not transmitted. Pulmonic second sound 
not accentuated. Abdomen tympanitic throughout, slight tender- 
ness on pressure over epigastrium. Liver dulness extends from fifth 
interspace to two fingers' breadth below costal margin where a smooth 
edge can be felt. Lower edge of spleen felt on full inspiration. Physical 
examination otherwise negative. Pulse 100, regular, of good quality. 
Temperature 98.4Â°. Urine, sp. gr. 1020, acid, no sugar, no albumen, 
Hg. 50%, red cells 3,172,000, no nucleated cells. Leucocytes 9200. 

1. What is the type of anEemia in this case? Typical secondary. 

2. Significanceof tbepatient's familyhii9tory7 None whatever. (Teacher may bring 

up here a discussion of the problem : in what cases is family history of value? ) 

3. What causes produce tarry stools? Bismuth, iron, blackberries, blood from high 

up in gut. 

4. How do you interpret the cardiac signs here present? Functional murmur. 

5. What are the commonest causes of splenic enlargement? Typhoid, malaria, 

rickets, cirrhosis, leucfemia, aneemia. 

6. What causes of hffimatemesb should be considered here? Gastric or duodenal 

ulcer, cirrhosis, aneurism. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Hepatic cirrhoais, ruptured esophageal varix, secondary aniemia, pas- 
sive congestion of stomach. 
Prognosis; Probably one to two years to live. 
Treatment: Stop liquor, treat aaEcmia, regulal* diet. Possibly Talma's operation."
"CASE 2

A fireman of 26 w&s exercising engine-horses, riding one and leading 
another. The led horse fell and, as he struggled to rise, wrenched 
severely the arm of the fireman, who had not let go the halter. He 
thought nothing of it at the time, but twenty-four hours later began 
to be distressed by a sense of weight and pressure beneath the sternum, 
near the attachment of the wrenched pectoral. Under medical advice 
he was laid oS duty and treated with liniments and counter-irritation, 
but without relief. Three weeks' vacation in the country benefited 
him, but on his return to work he was unable to drive or even to 
put on the foot brake without great exhaustion. Now he cannot 
walk a block fast without feeling tired out and experiencing a sense of 
pressure under the sternum. His wife tells him that he moans and 
grinds his teeth in his sleep. He has lost flesh, strength, and color. 

The heart's apex is in the fifth interspace and mammary line. 
There is reduplication of the apex second sound, and at the fifth left 
costal cartilage a systolic murmur, louder in the recumbent position. 
The pulmonic second sound is slightly louder than the aortic. 

Interrupted inspiration is detected in both fronts and both inter- 
scapular regions, also transient rales in the sixth intercostal space in 
the left axilla. Abdomen n^ative. The blood and urine are normal, 

1. What \b the usual Bignificance of maaning and teeth grinding during sleep? 

Functional cerebral irritation; no organic disease. Common in rickets and 
in neurotic children. Popular fallacy that ""worms"" are the cause. Tripes 
of delirium and of somnambulism may be here discussed. 

2. How is the lose of flesh, strength, and color to be explained? (See below under 

diagnosis.) Causes of emaciation and of pallor may be considered here. 

3. How are cardiac murmurs affected by change of position? All systolic mui^ 

murs are louder in the recumbent position. Presystolic murmurs are louder 
in the erect position, while diastolic murmurs are unaffected. 

4. IMagnoMS? Prognosis? Treatment? 

The Diagnosis is traumatic neurosis. Aneurism is excluded by the age, the 
acute onset, and the lack of evidence of mediastinal pressure. Local trauma 
is not important, for after the vacation the symptoms were general, not local. 
Chronic latent diseases ""lighted up'' by the accident (phthisis, ansmis, 
nephritis) are excluded by the negative physical examination. Traumatic 
neurosis is further suggested by the interval between the accident and the onset 
of symptoms. (Cerebral hemorrhage may come on many hours after a blow, 
but always produces physical signs of brain injury, as paralysis or aphasia.) 

The Prognosis is good if treatment is wise. He should be well in six months, 
but may have to change his occupation. 
, The Treatment is first encouragement and reassurance. Everything should 
be done to attract attention from the seat of supposed injury. Local apjidi- 
cations (here given) are the worst possible treatment. Advise work of 
another kind, a bitter tonic for appetite, and hydrotherapy for sleep."
"CASE 3

A medical s,tudent of 25 has been troubled with his joints for ten 
years. Attacks of pain and stiffness lay him up whenever he is sub- 
jected to any strain, mental or physical. He has had little or no fever, 
he thinks, in any of the attacks, but the pain and ewelling have been 
considerable. He has, as a rule, one or two bad attacks each year, with 
a week or two in bed. 

The knees, ankles, hips, hands, wrists, and elbows have been 
affected, and in every case some stiffness and more or less swelling 
has remained after the pain left. Both sides are affected nearly alike. 

Of late years the attacks have grown leas severe, especially since 
his family has grown more prosperous and more harmonious. He is 
now able to attend to most of his medical work. 

Examination shows no motion in the left wrist and very little in 
either ring finger. The range of motion in the knees and elbows is also 
considerably limited. The fingers are cold, mottled, and damp. Some 
of the finger joints and both wrists are doughy and semi-fluctuant. 
There is no evidence of bony enlargement anywhere. 

The heart and internal viscera are negative, but the boy is pale 
and rather thin. Blood and urine normal. 

1. Types and causes of arthritis? Infectious {including acute ""rheumatism"") 

atrophic, hypertrophic, gouty, neurojiathic, hemophilic. 

2. What varieties of arthritis are often aasociated with cardiac diaeaaeT Only tlie 

infectioustypes: e.g., ""rheumatic,"" septic, gonorrhceat, scarlatinal, pneumo- 
coccal. Tuberculous and syphilitic infections of joints are rarely associated 
with endocarditis. 

3. What important data are not mentioned in the above description? X-ray 

examination, data regarding gonorrhcea and regarding muscular atrophy. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: X-ray examination showed marked atrophy of the articular ends 
of the bones. There was marked muscular atrophy. No history of gonorrhoea 
or of any other infection. The absence of any known infection, the long 
progressive courae in a young person, the symmetrical involvement of joints, 
the vaso motor signs, the absence of marked fever, and the X-ray evidence 
all point to atrophic arthritis and serve (with the negative condition of the 
viscera, blood, and urine) to exclude other varieties. 

Prognosis: Most cases slowly progress, but with favorable environment, hy^enic 
and psychic, some cases are arrested, as in fact this one was, before crippling 
damage occurs. In such cases the injured joints never return to the normal, 
but the patient learns to adapt himself. Any mental or physical strain is 
likely to produce recrudescence, more or less serious. 

Treatment: Drugs have no effect save as they may help to improve the general 
nutrition (bitters, iron, arsenic). Salicylates do harm. Hest in the acute 
attacks, with warmth to the jomts, forced feeding, out-door life so far as the 
joints permit, encouragement and freedom from worry, are important aids 
to recovery. The excision of ankylosed joints may be necessary."
"CASE 4 

A married woman, 43 years old, is seen April 9. Family history 
negative. Haa had three children, the youngest being twenty years 
old, and no miscarriages. Eighteen years ago she began to suSer from 
profuse menstruation which became so excessive and exhausting that 
eighteen months ago the uterus and appendages were removed. In 
spite of the cessatloa of the hemorrhages she says that she has lost 
ground and grown paler more rapidly since the operation. For the 
past six months nose bleeds have been frequent and at times so ex- 
cessive that the nares have been plugged. She has had ""feverish 
turns,"" lasting several days at a time, but her chief complaint has 
been of weakness, great dyspnoea, palpitation, and attacks of faint- 
ness. Micturition has been more frequent for the past few years, but 
without any polyuria. Her legs and ankles have been considerably 
swollen, but this haa been much less apparent lately. About a month 
ago she had a copious epistaxis, followed, four days later, by a second, 
less severe, and has remained in bed ever since. Her temperature was 
first taken March 28, when it was found to be slightly above normal. 
Without discoverable local cause, it rose steadily till it reached 103"" 
six days later. It fell to normal two days later, but the evening record 
has since been several times as high as 99.4Â°. With the rise in her 
temperature, her color, previously very pale, became lemon-yellow, 
but the conjunctive remained a pearly white. She was greatly ex- 
hausted and somewhat delirious, vomiting occasionally either food or 
bile-stained mucus. A very grave prognosis was at this time given 
by the attending physician. 

When seen April 9, patient reported herself as feeling very well, 
and her mental condition was bright. She was markedly ansemic, 
but with only a slight yellow tinge remaining. The tongue and mucous 
membranes were very pale. There was a deep ulceration on the left 
side of the nasal septum and several crusts were seen on the right. A 
systolic murmur was heard in the vessels of the neck. The heart's 
apex was in the fifth space in the nipple line. The cardiac dulness 
extended a finger's breadth and a half to the right of sternum. A 
systolic murmur was heard all over the precordia, rough over the base, 
but becoming softer as the apex was approached and transmitted a 
short distance into the axilla. The pulmonic second was slightly ac- 
centuated. The upper border of the liver was at the fifth rib, and its 
smooth edge could be felt two fingers' breadth below the costal margin. 
The edge of the spleen was readily palpated. The ankles were slightly 
cedematous. The ophthalmoscope showed a normal fundus. Physical 
examination was otherwise negative. 

Urine, sp. gr. 1012, pale, acid, contains the slightest possible trace 
of albumen. Sediment slight, consisting of leucocytes, and a rare 
normal red cell; no casts. A blood count on April 3 showed 300,000 
reds, 5400 whites, Hgb. 10%. A differential count of 400 whites showed 
polymorphonuclear 72%, large mononuclear 12%, small mononuclear 
15%, eosinophiles 1%. Ten megaloblasts, 5 nonnoblasts, and 3 micro- 
blasts were seen. Poikilocytosis, macrocytosis, and polychromato- 
philia were present. A second count made to-day showed 1,000,000 
reds, 5800 whites, Hgb. 25%. A differential count of 300 white cells 
showed no special change in the proportions. Four megaloblasts, II 
normoblasts, and 2 microblasts were found. 

1. What 619 the common causes of frequent micturition in women and in men? 

In women, (a) nervousness and debility from any cause; (6) less often 
cystitis (""simple,"" gonorrhceaJ, tuberculous, or calculous); (c) the pressure of 
the pregnant utÂ«ruH or other tumors; (d) pyelitis (tuberculous or septic). 
In men, (a) prostatic obstruction and its results; (b) cystitis (gonDirhoeal, 
tuberculous, etc.); (c) pyelitis (as in women). Occasionally, in either sex, 
chronic nephritis may produce frequent as well as profuse micturition. 

2. What aie the possible causes of a systolic murmur like that here described? 

(a) Arterio sclerotic rou^ening of the aortic arch or of the aortic valves; 
(t) Ansmia and other causes of insufficient muscular contraction of the 
valve-orificea (but such murmurs are usually louder in the pulmonary area). 
(c) Aneurism of the aoHia; (d) Aortic stenosis (provided always that other 
signs of that lesion are present, thrill and plateau pulse especially). 

3. How are the ""feverish turns"" to be explained in this case? Fever in chronic 

anemia, especially pernicious aniemia, is not uncommon. AftÂ«r any profuse 
hemorrhage it often occurs in neurotic peisons. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The blood is chara^iteristic of pernicious ansmia. The hemorrhages 
are probably symptoms, not causes, of the anemia, for such a blood picture 
rarely if ever results from hemorrhage of the type here described. The 
respiratory, cardiac, and digestive symptoms, as well as the ledema, weakness, 
and fever, can be explained by the anemia. Other diseases are excluded by 
the absence of phjrsical signs pointing to them. 

Prognosis: A wave of improvement has apparently begun in this case and there 
may be one or two periods of great improvement, or even perfect health 
lasting several months each. Within two years death is almost certain to 
follow. Perliapts two cases in a hundred recover. 

Treatment: Fowler's solution, 2 drops after meals well diluted and increased 
1 drop daily until toxic symptoms appear, is considered the best method of 
prolonging life; 50 to 60 drops a day may be taken for some weeks. A few 
cases have improved after vigorous laxative treatment, t.e., enough cascara 
to produce several movements daily for weeks at a time. Beat, fresh air, and 
as much food as the stomach will bear are indicated. Hemorrhages are to be 
checked by pressure with gauie, with or without adrenalin solution. Iron, 
oxygen, and bone marrow are of no value."
"CASE 5 

A vigorous man of 62 comee of a gouty family, many members of 
which have been long^ived. His mother is said to have died of cancer, 
seat unknown; and a paternal uncle of gastric cancer. In recent years 
the patient had had two brief attacks of pain and swelling in the great 
toe-joint; he has also had eczema, said to have been considered of gouty 
or^in. For some years be has occasionally lost moderate quantities 
of fresh blood from the rectum. He has been a good, thoi^h not a 
free liver; and has aiwajrs taken much exercise in the open air. 

Six months ago he was duck shooting on Lake Erie, and, the 
water being very low, he says that for three weeks he worked 
harder than ever before in his life, pushing and dragging his boat 
in shallow water. After returning home be felt tired and was indis- 
posed to exert himself in any way. Soon after he b^an to suffer 
every few days about 1 p.m. from severe continuous pain just below 
the right costal border and outside the edge of the rectus muscle. The 
pain bore no apparent relation to the quality of food; the attacks lasted 
from one half an hour to three hours, and were relieved by the passage 
of gas upward or downward. Sometimes the escape of gas seemed to 
be promoted by cooking soda or aromatic spirits of ammonia. The 
pain is sometimes very sharply localized, even to a point no larger than 
the finger tip; but sometimes spreads to the left and downward over 
an area as large as the palm of the hand. Gradually the attacks have 
increased in frequency and come on daily; of late, toward 5 p.m. 
There has been at times slight nausea, apparently due to the extreme 
severity of the pain. He never vomited until two days before he was 
seen, then repeatedly during the night; the vomitus was not character- 
istic. Position does not seem to influence the pain except in so far as 
it may aid the expulsion of gas. 

A week or ten days before he was seen, he had on two successive 
days black movements of the bowels, one very copious, unattended by 
rectal pain, faintness, or subsequent loss of color. Fever has been 
absent, and the urine negative. The appetite and ordinary digestion 
have been fair; there has been no noticeable loss of flesh or color. 
The tongue is slightly coated, the fingers show some gouty deposits, 
there is some tenderness on deep pressure just above and to the right 
of the navel; the smooth edge of the liver can be felt to descend 
below the right costal border, but only on full inspiration. Physical 
examination is otherwise negative. 

1. What diaeasee often cause epigastric pain relieved by the belching of gsa? Jyya- 
pepMa of various types, angiiia pectoris, neurasthenia. Usually motor dis- 
turbance and not fermeatation is the cause of such belching.

2. What type of stomikch trouble is to be expected at the age of 627 Cancer; 

rarely ulcer; sometimee the ^wtric Hymptonia depending on gall-etones and 
their reaulta. 

3. What U the relation of the gout to the other syinptoinsT *Gout and arterio- 

sderoMs are often closely aaBOciated. Arterio-sclerofiia is one of the diagnoaes 
to be conaideced in this case. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnoeia: Duodenal ulcer is etrani^y suggested by the position and sharp 
localiiation of a pain which tÂ«nd.i to occur when the stomach is empty, by 
the tarry stools uid tlie reliel by alkalies. Hepatic cirrhosis is possible, but 
rarely causes such pain and cannot be diagnosed unless evidence of portal 
stasis appears. Angina pectoris may cause abdominal pain relieved by belch- 
ing, but never produces melama. There ate no physical evidences of artorio- 
aclerosis, but it may nevertheless be present. On the whole, the chief 
symptoms in the case seem becit explained by the diagnosis of duodenal 
uloer. The coiuM of the case apparently confirmed this diagnosis. 

ProptafOB: Most cases recover under proper treatment in the course of many 
months, but relapses are not uncommon. 

Treatment: Exclusive rectal feeding for ten days. Then a gradual return to 
full diet with meat and fish almost or quite excluded. Carbohydrates and 
fats should make up almost the whole of his diet, but milk may be taken 
fntify. If the symptoms persist or recur, operation may be necessary."
"CASE 6 

A child, 7 years of age, of healthy parentage, had made frequent 
complaint of pain in the left side of abdomen and was found by her 
mother to be rapidly losing flesh and strength. There was also an ac- 
count of quite frequent voiding of high-colored urine, with a brownish 
sediment. 

After several weeks the emaciation progressing, the mother noticed 
that the left side of the abdomen was larger than the right; that there 
was pain and tenderness on pressure, and that periods of "" constipation "" 
occurred, followed by the escape of large quantities of semi-liquid fÂ«ces, 
without much change in the size of abdomen or relief to the pain and 
tenderness in left lumbar region. 

About this time the patient was taken to a physician, who confirmed 
the mother's observation of loss of flesh and strength, for the child was 
pale or sallow, emaciated and extremely weak. In the left lumbar 
region a ma^, irregular in outline and surface, painful on palpation, 
extended into the umbilical region and upwards to the margin of ribs 
in front; percussion showed tympanitic resonance over the central 
portion of the tumor. Elsewhere the tumor was flat on percussion. 

A specimen of urine showed: Reaction, acid; sp. gr. 1014; sediment, 
brownish and consisting of blood and brown granular matter. There 
were no casts, and the quantity of albumen present was small. 

1. What abdominal tumors are most frequent in children? Safcoraa of kidney; 

congenital qrstic kidney, dilated colon, secondary enlargements of spleen and 

2. How are tumore of the kidney to be diHtinguiahed from enlargement of the 

spleen? The sharp edge of the spleen and its notch can usually be felt. The 
kidney produces a rounded tumor palpable bimanualiy with one hand in the 
flank. The inflated colon traverses tumors of the kidney but pssaes behind 
those of the spleen. 

3. DiagnoMS? Prognosis? Treatment? 

IMagnoais: The age, the .tumor, the emaciation, the luematuria without casts, 
the apparent anfemia, strongly suggest malignant disease of the kidney, and 
at this age sareoma is the commonest type of malignant renal disease. Con- 
genital cystic disease of the kidneys does not produce such cachexia and is 
almost never associated with hematuria. The condition of the boweb ex- 
cluded dilated colon. The characteristics of this tumor are not those of a 
spleen. The tympanitic resonance over its centre is very possibly due to 
the colon. 

Prognosis: Recovery after operation has occurred, but b rare. Operation in 
this case confirmed the diagnosis, but was followed by recurrence and death 
mx months later. 

Treatment: Surgical interference offers the only hope of recovery and should 
be undertaken at once. Medical treatment can only alleviate the present 
symptoms, â i.e., the emaciation, htematuria, and pain."
"CASE 7 

A married woman of 50, has had three children, the youngest 17, 
no miscarriage, and has passed the menopause without disturb- 
ance. Soon after the birth of her second child she became unconscious 
with dilated pupils, had convulsions, right hemiplegia and aphasia 
but recovered entirely. Her domestic life has not been happy for some 
years. During the eighteen months that she has been under the care 
of her present attendant she has had emotional attacks, periods of 
mental depression and insomnia, goes to bed, refuses food, and if crossed 
becomes hysterical. Passed last summer in the country with benefit. 
In the autumn she went to the office of her physician for swelling of 
the face and puffiness of the eyelids, and complained that the skin was 
dry and perspiration deficient. Nine months later these symptoms 
persist. She denies special sensitiveness to cold. Several examina- 
tions of the urine have been made with negative results. The twenty- 
four-hour quantity is not known. The pulse is 72, regular; the tem- 
perature normal; the blood negative; the tongue clear. The complexion 
is somewhat waxy; the eyelids are rather baggy and translucent; the 
whole face had a puffy look. The skin ^ on a warm day, June 17 â 
is slightly moist. Visceral examination is negative except for a mobile 
right kidney. No motor paralysis; reflexes and sensibility normal. 

1 . What is the significance of the mobile right kidney in relation to the other symp- 

toma of this catief It is inugnificant and the physician should on no account 
mention its presence, which may give rise to great alarm. 

2. What was the cause of the hemiplegia and aphasia? The toxnmia known as 

eclampsia seems to account for them. A small cerebral hemorrhage is 
possible. 

3. What test would make the diagnosis easier? (See diagnosis.) 

4. Diagnosis? PrognoÂ«s7 Treatment? 

Diagnosis; The age and sex, the mental symptoms, the dry skin and puffy, 
warty face, with negative urine and heart, strongly suggest myxcedema. 
The therapeutic test (see question 3) confirmed this suggestion. Thyroid 
extract produced a rapid improvement and final cessation of all the symptoms. 
The only atypical features of the case are the absence of subnormal tempera- 
ture and of sensitiveness to cold. The apparently eclamptic seizure in early 
hfe is interesting in view of the possible connection between eclampsia and 
deficient thyroid activity which various writers have recently suggested. 

Prognosis: Under persistent thyroid treatment she should remain well for her 
natural term of life. 

Treatment; Any of the standard thyroid tablets may be given in doses of 2 
grains thrice daily, gradually increadng until the pulse rate quickens. The 
drug should then be continued at whatever dose can be borne without ma- 
terially increasing the pulse rate above normal. Considerable loss of weight 
usually takes place in the earlier weeks of treatment."
"CASE 8 

A coachman, 42 years old, of good family history, ia seen April 20. 
Health has always been good except for a severe attack of penumonia 
three years ago, which was followed by phlebitis in the left femoral vein. 
The left leg has remained somewhat swollen, and has been tense and 
rather painful toward night. It has caused rather more discomfort 
than usual during the past few days. Yesterday morning he got up 
feeling as usual , but on reaching the house of bis employer felt nauseated 
and had some diarrhuea, which continued during the day. He felt 
feverish and weak. Went to work again this momiag, but gave up 
after half an hour owing to nausea and pain in the lower abdomen, and 
went to bed. At eleven o'clock had a distinct chill. Was seen for the 
first time at 12.45 p.m. The patient was a stout man who looked acutely 
sick. The chest was negative. Owing to a thick fat layer, examina- 
tion of the abdomen was not altogether satisfactory; it was some- 
what distended and tympanitic and there was considerable tenderness 
over the lower portion below the level of the iliac crests, but no 
area of special tenderness, nor could a tumor be felt anjnvhere. The 
left leg was somewhat larger than the right throughout. The skin 
below the knee pitted slightly on pressure. There was a little tender- 
ness over the femoral ring. The temperature was then 103, pulse 110, 
respirations 26. At 3 p.m. urgent summons were received to call 
immediately as the patient had had a convulsion, was breathing 
rapidly and with great difficulty, and was very cyanotic. 

1. Wliat are tbe commonest causea of cyanosis? Heart disease (valvular or parietal), 

emphyeema, pneumonia, asthma, metluemoglobiiuemia (usually from acetaniltd 
in headache powders). 

2. What important data do you miss in the account of this case? A leucocyte 

count and urinary examination. 

3. Do you expect a 1^ to remain swollen three years aftÂ«r an attack of phlebitis? 

Yes; the leg does not often regain its normal size. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The symptoms at the first visit were very indecisive. Diarrhcea, 
nausea, abdominal pain with fever and weakness, suggest nothing more than 
acute gaatro-enteritis, and even the tenderness found in the lower abdomen 
is not distinctive. Peritonitis (possibly from appendicitis) was considered. 
But the history of an old femoral thrombosis and the tenderness over the 
femoral ring lead us to think that the thrombus may have progressed up 
into the abdominal veins and to interpret the later puhnonary symptoms 
(sudden onset of ds^ncea and cyanosis) as pulmonary embolism from the 
thrombosed abdominal veins. Autopsy showed this condition, 

Frognods: Pulmonary embolism is almost invariably fatal within a few min- 
utes or hours, but a few cases with all signs of the disease have recovered. 

Treatment; Oxygen is usually administered and may possibly be of some ser- 
vice. Otherwise tbe treatment is purely expectant and symptomatic."
"CASE 9 

J. B., male, aged 32 (occupation, cook), came to the out- 
patient department of the hospital Jan. 6, 1899. His family history 
was negative and previous history good. He denied any syphilitic 
infection, but admitted having had a urethritis some years previously. 
He had never had an attack similar in character to this. The present 
illness he dated from December 30, 1898, eight days before applying for 
relief at the hospital. The first symptoms seemed to have come on 
rather suddenly with a rigor of marked severity, followed by fever and, 
later, by profuse sweating. Almost immediately afterward he was 
seized with intense muscular pains, extending over the trunk and limbs; 
these pains were agonizing in character, increased on the slightest exer- 
tion, and had been present, with varying degrees of severity, until his 
admission. They prevented him from sleeping, and were spoken of 
by the patient as being not unlike rheumatism, i.e., dull and aching, 
while he was in the recumbent posture, becoming intensely lancinating 
as soon as the slightest exercise was attempted. His appetite, which 
had previously been of the beat, was absolutely lost and he had eaten 
nothing for three days. With the exception of some slight frequency 
of micturition and a slight cough with expectoration, there was nothing 
else of importance in the history of the illness. 

Examination: The patient is rather a large, well-formed man, the 
mucous membranes of good color, tongue moist, and with a slight white 
fur. The eyes are markedly injected, the eyelids slightly but distinctly 
(edematous, and an erythematous area above the swelling. Negative 
results were obtained everywhere on auscultation and percussion, 
except at the bases of both lungs behind, where a few moist rales were 
made out. The heart sounds were quite clear. The liver and spleen were 
not palpable; the abdomen was soft and natural in appearance, nega- 
tive results being obtained on palpation. No rose spots were seen. 
There was no superficial glandular enlargement. Pulse was 100, 
respiration 24 to the minute. The temperature ranged in the vicimty 
of 103"" for three weeks and then gradually subsided. The urine was 
normal in color, acid, sp. gr. 1026. Microscopically, it showed 
pus-corpuscles in considerable quantity, epithelial cells, and a few 
mucous cylinders. 

1, What important informatioQ might be gained hj testing; the knee-jerks in this 

case? Neuritis â one of the diagnoaes to be considered in this case would 
be suggested if the knee-jerks were diminished or absent. 

2. Commonest causes (a) of absent knee-jerk? (6) of increased knee-jerk? (a) Neuritis, 

tabes, anterior poliomyelitis. (6) Brain hemorrhage or other organic brain 
lesion (focal or diffuse), spastic paraplegia, pressure myelitis, chronic arthritis.

3. What infectiotu diaeaaM cause severe pains in the trunk and limba? Grippe, 

tonnUttia, variola, dengue, trichiniasis, yellow (ever. Milder pains accompany 
some caees of typhoid, sepsis, pneumonia, or any other infection. 

4. What further examinations would throw light, upon your preliminary diagnosis 

here? Blood examination and tests of the deep reBexes. 
6, Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Blood examination showed a leucocytoeis. This suggested a dif- 
ferential count which revealed a very marked eoainophilia. A bit of the 
biceps muscle was then excised and trichina were demonstrated in it by 
histological examination. If blood examination is included in our investiga- 
tion of such a case, diagnosis (in temperate climatÂ«8) is usually very easy as 
there is no other chronic febrile disease with eosinophilia and severe muscu- 
lar ptuus. In the tropics other fevers complicated by the presence of 
intÂ«stinal parasites may be hard to distinguish from trichiniasis unless 
trichine are found in the muscles. In any climate many cases closely 
simulate typhoid and without blood examination are sura to be mbtaken 
for it. Others pass as "" muscular rheumatism."" 

Frt^inosia: Host cases recover in the couise of a few months or less. Belapaes 

Treatment is thus far inefficient. We seek to relieve pain and support strength." 
"CASE 10 

The patient is a contractor of 50. He ia of heavy build, stout 
and red in the face. For several years he has had violent cough in the 
winter, accompanied by vomiting. A daughter of 16 some years ago 
ran off with a man and got married. He tooic to his bed, cursed, cried, 
called for his pistols and was going to kill the husband, but calmed 
down soon and the young people were sent for. His physician thinks 
he does not use alcohol in notable excess. Two weeks ago he began 
to complain of tearing and cutting pains in his legs, accompanied by 
slight cedema, and for several day^ now he has been in his bed. Fever 
has been absent. There has been some vomiting, not specially char- 
acteristic in any way. He has been much excited and has threatened 
to kill all Democrats. Sleep has been poor. The pains in the legs 
have continued, but less severely since he took to bed. 

The pulse is 80, regular, the tongue heavily coated, thorax negative. 
The edge of the liver can be felt two inches below the costal border, 
apparently smooth of surface. Motion and tactile sensibility in the 
legs seem normal, but the leg muscles are tender and the knee-jerks 
are very slight, even on reenforcgment. The urine report is negative. 

1. Whftt important facts about his eariy history do we need to knowT Has he 

bad syphilis? How much alcohol has he taken? 

2. Why is his sleep poor? Poor Bleep in an active man should always tni&iest 

alcoholism, though there are of course numy other causes. 

3. Why is the liver smooth? All types of enlarged liver {except those due to 

cancer and Byphilis) are usually smooth as felt through the belly wall. The 
""hobnails"" of cirrhosis can rarely be felt, so that smoothness does not exclude 
cirrhosis. Fatty infiltrttion seems, however, more likely. 

4. Wliat is meant by reenforcement of knee-jerks? We distract the patient's 

attention and concentrate brain control on the muscles of his hands by mak- 
ing him lock his bands together and then break them apart just when 
we tap on the patella tendon. This tends to ""bring out"" knee-jerks. 

5. How is the ledema of the legs to be accounted for? (3ee diagnosis.) 

6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The pains and tenderness in the legs, with diminished knee-jerks 
and cedema, strongly suggest neuritis. The pupils must be tested. If they are 
normal, tabes is unhkely, especially as the pains here present are not at all 
characteristic of tabes. It should be pointed out that oedema is not un- 
common in neuritis, not only in the epidemic form (""wet"" beri-beri) but in 
ordinary alcoholic cases. Other causes of (edema (cardiac, renal, hemic, 
local â e.g., varicose veins) must be excluded. 

The cause of the neuritis is probably alcoholism, despite his physician's state- 
ment. This would also explain mental symptoms, vomiting, and enlarged 
liver. Dementia paralytica is excluded by the local signs in the legs and liver. 

Prognous: If alcohol is given up recovery should follow. It proved so. 

Treatment: Stop alcohol. Relieve pain by local applications and electricity. 
Give bromide and trional for sleep, capsicum and nux vomica for appetite." 
"CASE 11 

A female domestic, 29 years old, single, lost her father, a dissipated 
man, from phthisis. She herself was chlorotic five years ago, but has 
been otherwise well. A year ago she took a severe coid, and after a 
few days felt a sudden intense pain in the left lower axilla. Cough 
followed, with little or no sputa. She was not long laid up, but has 
been short of breath on exertion ever since. She denies persistent 
cough, and states that it is present only when she takes cold; expec- 
toration at these times is scanty, but has several times been blood- 
streaked. She thinks she has lost no flesh and has not been feverish. 
She has been and is now steadily at work. Her employer sends her to 
be looked at while the physician is visiting a member of the family. 

The general appearance is that of health; pulse and temperature 
normal. She complains only of dyspnoea on exertion, dry cough, and 
anorexia. The chest is symmetrical; the interspaces are well defined; 
no cardiac impulse is visible; the left chest dilates less than the right. 
The heart sounds are loudest, and the impulse best felt just below the 
ensiform cartilage; the sounds are normal. The cardiac dulness seems 
to extend farther than usual to the right of the sternum. The right 
chest is hyper-resonant throughout, with puerile respiration. The left 
chest, including the cardiac area, is tympanitic with very feeble respi- 
ration and absence of vocal fremitus. In the left lower axilla there 
is faint, amphoric breathing. 

1. What pulmonaiy diseases cause pain? Pleurisy (""simple,"" tuberculous, or 

pneumonic), malignant disease. 

2. Significance of bloody sputa? If blood appears in streaks it is usually from 

the throat (pharyngitis) . In phthisis blood is usually in larger amount. 

3. What do jou infer from the fact that this patient has not felt sick enough to 

disable her from work and has the appearance of health? The disease, what- 
ever it is, must be producing chiefly, local, not constitutional effects. 

4. Under what conditions is the cardia<! impulse absent? Thick chest walls or 

emphysema may hide the heart; pleural effusion, pneumothorax or adhesions 
may displace it behind the atemum. Its beat may be too weak to feel. 

5. In what diseases may cardiac dulness extend more than 2 cm. beyond the 

ri^t eternal margin? Whenever the ri^t heart is distended, and whenever 
the heart is displaced to the right from any cause. 

6. Significance of puerile respiration? Extra work done by the lung. 

7. What changes in the blood and urine do you expect in this ease? Normal 

blood, possibly a slight leucocytoais. Probably normal urine; possibly albu- 
minuria and a few casts. 

8. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Succussion produced a loud splash. Pneumobydrothorax was 
obvious, probably ot tuberculous origin. The latency of symptoms is sur- 
prising but not unprecedented. Bacilli were later found in the sputa. 
Prognosis: That of moderately severe phthisis, not incipient and not advanced- 
Treatment: Forced feeding, rest in the open air; later, moderate exercise."
"CASE 12 

A Bchool-teacher, single, 24 years old, seen April 9. Family history 
unimportant. Never strong. Scarlet fever and measles in childhood. 
Brain fever at 9, pneumonia at 13, nervous prostration at 16, ""con- 
gestion of the brain and spinal cord"" at 19 from overwork at college. 
One year ago was laid up for two months by a ""general breakdown."" 
Last summer broke down with, she says, "" every symptom of pulmonary 
tuberculosis."" Catamenia irregular, five weeks to three or four months, 
appeared laat ten days ago. Has taught night school in addition to 
her regular work since October, and since December has had a series 
of colds with cough and some expectoration. Has complained of 
general lassitude until the afternoon when she feels fairly well. Six 
weeks ago was called home to nurse her mother in her last illness, 
apoplexy. Returned ten days ago all used up. Two days later found 
that she was suddenly unable to distinguish letters in book she was 
reading. She rose to call for help and fell. Was conscious when found, 
but unable to assist herself. Had a series of convulsions during the 
night and was kept under ether by her attending physician. Since 
then she has felt tired and weak with constant headache, but has not 
been confined strictly to bed. No appetite. Bowels constipated. 
Her eyesight has returned. About half an hour ago she was found 
in the following condition: 

A thin, delicate, half starved looking girl, apparently unconscious, 
Ijfing flat on her back in bed, motionless, except for some tremor of the 
eyelids. She is so rigidly extended that with the hand beneath her neck 
she can be lifted like a log until she rests only on her heels. Her feet 
are extended to the utmost and the toes are strongly flexed. Her arms 
and hands are rigidly extended and held close to her sides, but can be 
bent by persistent pressure. When released they immediately resume 
their former position. The fingers are extended and adducted, the 
accoucheur's hand. The acetone odor of the breath can be detected 
several feet away. Loud calls, pinching, pricking with a pin, produce 
no response except an occasional flickering of the eyelids. When the 
hand is placed closely over her nose and mouth she struggles until 
freed. The condition of the pupils, which probably react to light, is 
made out with difficulty as the eyelids resist attempts to open them. 
The eyes are turned upward. Heart, lungs, and abdominal viscera 
seem normal. Temperature 99Â°. Pulse 110, soft, easily compressed. 
Respiration normal. Urine, 35 oz., normal color, acid, sp. gr. 1022. Al- 
bumen, very slight trace. Sugar absent. Ferric chloride test positive. 
Sediment contains a rare hyaline and finely granular cast. Hg. 90%. 
Whites 9000.

.. What gaeta con ve make regarding the nature of her early UkteesesT As a 

rule, phrases of thb kind turn out to mean ueurasthenia. 
[. What is the general significance of an improvement of all symptoms in the 
aftÂ«rnoon7 If symptoms are legularly worse in the aftÂ«moon, what should 
be suspected? Antemic patients and neurasthenics are apt to be better in the 
latter part of the day. Patients who are worse in the afternoon often have 
fever (tuberculosis, malaria, typhoid), but simple fatigue may be the cause. 
I, Significance of tremor of the eyelids? Its distinction from habit chorea and 
other facial spasms? Usually hysterical or neurotic. The motions are 
finer and more continuous than any other spasm. 
:. Under what conditions is the ferric chloride test in the urine to be obtained? 
(a) Whenever carbohydratÂ« food is not adequately utilized. This may be 
because it is not ingested or net retained (ae in starvation, prolonged vomit- 
ing, or rectal alimentation), because it is not abtorbed (diarrhcea, tuberculous 
peritonitis) or jial m^abolixed (diabetes). In this case the semi^tarvatioa 
readily explains the reaction, (b) In a few conditions the ferric chloride 
test cannot be ao explained â e^., on a salt-free diet the reaction has been 
found to be strongly marked. 
'. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: With a negative physical examination (except for the urine which 
yields no information of diagnostic value) the diagnosis probably lies between 
the foUowing alternatives: Epilepsy, hystÂ«ria, meningitis, autointoxicatbn. 

Epilep^ is suggested by the history of convulsions; against it are all the 
facta of the present condition and most of those in the past history which 
point strongly to hygteria. Hysteria often follows upon just such a history 
of neuroses in youth, physical and psychical exhaustion, and mistaken treat- 
ment (etherization). The tendency to opisthotonos and tonic conditions of 
the extremities, the tremor of the lids and rolling up of eyeballs, the fact that 
she can be roused to purposeful action by appropriate stimuli (covering her 
mouth and nose) deÂ«{)ite anicethesia to a pin prick â all point strongly to 
hysteria. 

Meningitis may exist without temperature or leucocytosis (thou^ it usually 
produces both), but cannot be diagnosed unless headache, retraction of the 
neck and eye symptoms (squint, pto^, papillary or retinal changes) are 
present. 

Autointoxication is very possibly present in all hysteria, and in view of the 
starvation that is probably an element in this case it is not unlikely that 
the system is in some way poisoning itself, but such theories are not at present 
capable of clinical verification. 

Prognosis: She will probably never t* quite like other people, but it the treat- 
ment is wise, patient, and prolonged, she may live a long, fairly useful and 
not unhappy life. Recurrence of symptoms is to be expected whenever she 
gets ""run down"" from any cause. 

Treatment: For the present, seclusion and forced feeding are the most im- 
portant indications. A long rest with change of scene, occupation fitted 
to her needs, the personal influence of a wise friend or physician, are likely 
to help her very much. The problem is chiefly one of education, â physical, 
mental, and moral."
"CASE 13 

A factory overseer of 63 had long been subject to conatipation, and 
for two years had had right inguinal hernia. Otherwise his previoua 
history was excellent. On the day before his illness he had what he 
regarded as a satisfactory movement of the bowels. That night he ate 
heartily of clam-chowder and strawberries. The next afternoon he felt 
some abdominal diaeomfort. later, while taking a bath, he found his 
hernia was down (as he had taken the truss off), and he found more 
difficulty than usual in replacing it. That night he vomited many 
times, the first vomitus suggesting strawberries, and had great abdom- 
inal pain, not localized. When seen next morning at 4 a.m., he was 
not collapsed. The tongue was moist, with a slight white coat. Tem- 
perature 98.4Â°, pulse 60, respiration 14. The abdomen was soft, not 
tender. The hernia was found to be perfectly reduced. Nothing 
abnormal was felt per anum. The pain required an injection of 
morphia, gr. 4. Nausea was so troublesome tiiat the patient refused 
even bits of ice. Nothing whatever passed the bowels. On the second 
day the vomiting became stercoraceous. On the third day the vomiting 
persisted. Temperature 98.5Â°, pulse 68. Large enemata (SJ quarts) 
had been given without apparent benefit. The belly was distended, 
rather hard, not tender. In the right side an ill-defined resistance 
was felt, corresponding to the ascending colon. 

1. What cause can you suggest for the alow reepirotion in this case? Poesibly 

he has alTeady beea given morphia. (Hehearse the common causes of slow 
breathing.) 

2. How does the temperature record help ua here? It tends to exclude peritonitis. 

3. Causes of pyrexia and of subnormal temperature: (a) Infections with or with- 

out inflammation; (b) toxemia {e.g,, in eclampsia) ; (c) disturbance of heat-regu- 
lation, aa in aunatroke; (d) after use of atropine and in nervous excitement. 
Subnormal temperature ia a measure of the degree of prostration from any 
exhausting or wasting disease (nephritis, cancer, heart disease, myxcedenut). 

4. Is the combination of clam chowder and strawberries a particularly mdigestible 

mixture? What is its probable relation to this case? Not in a normal 
stomach. Probably no relation to this case. (Teacher may here give hie 
views on indigestible combinations of food.) 

5. Causes of stercoraceous vomiting? Intestinal obstruction and general peri- 
' tonitis. 
What can be inferred from the results of the enemata in this case? That the 

obstruction is above the sigmoid flexure. 
'7, Significance of the tongue in disease? in this case? A coated tongue baa 
little diagnostic significance in general or in this case, since it is present in 
BO many conditions of health and disease. A clean tongue with dyspeptic 
symptoms suggests hyperehlorhydria or extra-gastric disease. 

Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

IKagnosis: Intestinal obstruction is obviously present. Ita cause might be 
tbe hemia reduced ""en bloc,"" but from the ehortnees of ita stay outride tbe 
body this ie unlikely. At this patient's age cancer is by far the commonest 
cause of obatruotion. The acute onset of BymptomB without previous consti- 
pation or other complaints is not surprising, for it is well known that cancer- 
ous stricture may suddenly ""shut down"" after existing for months without 
symptoms. The mass in tbe ascending colon is probably feces coIIectÂ«d 
behind a cancer at the hepatic flexure. 

Prognosis: Good for tempoisry relief after operation. Becurrenoe probable 
within eighteen months, 

TiÂ«atment: Inunodiate surpcal interference."
"CASE 14 

J. S-i aged 40 years, a merchant, waa Been in consultation April 8 
at 10 P.M. 

He had suffered for years with indigestion, and had lost considerably 
in weight. For several months he had been treated by an eminent 
specialist in diseases of the stomach. His stomach had been washed 
out for three weeks. He had been on a liquid diet. He had made 
no improvement and for one week had remained in bed on account of 
an aggravation of epigastric pain. At one o'clock on the 8th of April 
he got out of bed and went to the back door to look out. While 
there he was seized with sudden severe pain in the abdomen. He 
vomited and crawled back to bed. His attending physician saw him 
at 3 P.M. He found his pulse 90, temperature 101Â°, abdomen ot 
board-like rigidity, tender everywhere, but much more tender in the 
epigastrium. He did not show much shock. His physician adminis- 
tered i grain of morphine and saw him again at 9 p.m. He was then 
somewhat improved, and his spasm was a little less. The consultant 
saw him at 11 p.m., and found him pale, sick-looking, with no peritoneal 
facies and no marked shock. There was distinct spasm and tender- 
ness in the epigastrium, shading off into other regions of the abdomen, 
which was generally retracted. There was no dulness. The tongue 
was moist. Pulse 90, temperature 101.4Â°. 

1. What is the aignificaace of the peritoneal facies and why was it absent in this 

case? Vomiting, fear, or both, are the usual cauaes of the peritoneal faciee, 
which is oftÂ«n seen in simple aeaackness. The absence of ""shock"" or of 
recent vomiting explains the absence of this ""peritoneal faciea."" 

2. In what diseases is the use of the stomach tube contraindicated? When aneu- 

rism or gastric ulcer is suspected, or in very weak patients. 

3. What further data might be of value in diagnosis here? Blood examination, 

urinary examination, color of conjunctivie. (See also next question.) 

4. How can we exclude plumbism? By careful questioning, examination ot the 

gums, blood, and extensor muscles (wrist drop). Tabes dorsalis? By testing 
pupils and knee-jerks. Malaria? Search for parasites and enlarged spleen, 

5. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Lead, tabes, and malaria were excluded; laparotomy showed a perfo- 
rated gastric ulcer (anterior gaaCnc surface) walled oS by fresh adhesions. 
Posterior gastro enterostomy was done. Three months later the patient had 
gained markedly in weight and was in excellent condition. Acute cholecys- 
titis and acute pancreatitis were excluded positively only by the operation. 
The preceding gastric symptoms suggested the stomach as the source of the 
trouble, but are compatible with pancreatitis or gall-bladder trouble. 

Prognosis: The ultimate result in cases of this type we do not yet know. 

Treatment: Surgical interference was obviously indicated."
"CASE 15

A paper hanger, 45 years old, is seen May 17. Hie history ob- 
tained from the attending physician, who made his first call May 3, 
was as follows: The patient uses alcohol in moderation, and has had no 
previous illness. April 27 he had a chill followed by sharp pain in the 
lower right chest, some cough with bloody expectoration, and short- 
ness of breath. He has been in bed ever since. On May 3 the right 
chest was dull below the fourth rib in front and below mid-scapula 
behind, with broncho-vesicular respiration, increased voice and vocal 
fremitus. The cardiac apex was in the fifth space just outside the 
nipple line. No murmurs. The second pulmonic sound was accentu- 
ated. The temperature ran between 101Â° and 102.5Â° until the morning 
of May 8, when it fell to 99Â°. Since then it has been irregular, varying 
between 100Â° and 102Â°. The respirations were 35 until the 8th, when 
they fell to 28, where they have since remained. The pulse has varied 
between 100 and 110. Urine negative. The patient has lost strength 
and weight. The signs in the lungs have gradually changed; now the 
right chest seems fuller than the left and moves but little with respira- 
tion. It is flat throughout on percussion, with diminished vocal reso- 
nance and fremitus. Respiration is bronchial down to the fifth rib in 
front, growing gradually feebler below that point until it is lost toward 
the base. Feeble bronchial respiration is heard over the back, with 
numerous medium moist rales at the angle of scapula. The heart 
remains as before. The smooth edge of the liver is felt two inches 
below the costal margin. White cells, 28,000, A needle was intro- 
duced on the 14th in the eighth interspace in the posterior axillary line, 
and again to-day an inch or two farther back. It appeared to enter a 
solid body, and only a drop or two of blood was obtained. 

1. In what diseases ia bronchial breathing to be beard? PhthJais, pneumonia, 

aome cases of pleural efCusion, malignant disease, atelectasis. 

2. Why is the pulmonic second sound accentuated hereT Because of the obstruc- 

tion to the pulmonary circulation due to the disease below described. 

3. Is the ei^th interspace a safe place to tap in a case like this? It is safe if 

the diaphragm is not pushed up. In hepatic abscess I have seen the liver 
punctured (through the diaphragm) by a needle introduced through the 
eighth apace in the posterior axillary line. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis; Solidification of the whole lung, lasting sixteen days and proved 
by the result of puncture, might be due to tuberculosis, pneumonia (unresolved), 
or malignant disease. Loss of flesh and color is rare in unresolved pneumonia. 
Prominency of one chest is not produced by tuberculosis, and so high a leuco- 
cytosis, without evidences of cavities and purulent sputa, is almost unknown. 
Malignant disease was found at autopsy three months later. 
Prognosis: A few months of suffering. Treatment: Symptomatic, "
"CASE 16 

A clergyman, 60 yeara o)d, gave the following account of his caae. 
Since he began to preach he has been subject to insomnia, but it is 
under bis control unless he is excited by mental labor, the effects of 
which are most marked when it occupies the evening. Eyes weak for 
forty years, but no worse of late. Though the voice is clear, its use in 
lecturing or preaching is at times, when he is debilitated, somewhat 
painful and requires much exertion. Appetite good, but two to three 
hours after eating he sometimes has a kind of epigastric pain or feeling 
of heat, not dependent on amount or character of food, unless it be 
worse when he eats little. Ice water seems to touch a raw spot. 
Bowels tend to constipation since early childhood. For many years 
haa been troubled, especially when he is debilitated, by a sensation 
over the whole body as if pricked by innumerable needles. 

Four years ago, while much exhausted by mental labor, went to a 
watering place, where he was put on low diet, reducing remedies, and 
frequent baths. At the end of four months, while at. breakfast, was 
attacked with vertigo and began to talk with great volubility but 
incoherently. For three days, which were a blank to him, hie condi- 
tion excited much alarm, but at the end of that time his mind became 
clear and there has been no return of symptoms since. There was 
numbnesa of the hands and feet at time of the attack. 

In the two last yeara has had five attacks of pain in upper abdomen, 
without known cauae, very severe and accompanied by distention and 
general perspiration. One of these came oh after conduetti^ an exam- 
ination four hours long, another after eating hastily. Otherwise no 
cause known. Pain generally began at 9 p.m., and lasted till midnight. 
No other symptoms noticed before, during, or after the attack of pain. 

1. For what should one search especiaUy in making a phyBical examinatloD of this 

patient? The stigmata of hj'ateria, arterio-aclerosis, the signs of tabes or 
dementia paralytica (pupils, knee-jerks, speech-writing, mental condition). 

2. What gastric anomaly do the digestive symptoms suggest? Hyperchlotfaydria. 

3. If his gastric symptoms had appeared for the first time within a year what 

diagnoses should be considered? Gastric cancer, gall-stones, duodenal ulcer. 

4. Nome the most important causes of paroxysmal epigastric pain. Peptic ulcer, 

gall-stones, plumbism, tabes, malaria, urtemia, and pancreatitis, 
6. Diagnosis? Prognoste? Treatment? 

Diagnoffls: Since physical examination was negative and the patient was able 
to work hard despite his many symptoms, the dtagno^ of neurasthenia was 
made; the improvement under treatment suited to that condition confirmed 
the diagnosis. The attack at the watering-place was apparently due to 
cerebral aniemia, the result of wrong treatment. 

Prognosis; Improvement should follow proper and patient treatment. 

Treatment: SmaJI, frequent, low-proteid meals; recreation. No evening work." 
"CASE 17 

A manufacturer, of 64, of good inheritance and habits, is seen in 
October, 1898. In childhood he was laid up for a time with what he 
' thinks was rheumatism, and he ha^ since had pains now and then, not 
laying him up, attributed by him to rheumatism. He has been a very 
active man and has ridden a wheel. Ten years ago he fell on the ice 
while skating, striking the back of his head. He was unconscious for 
a week, and in bed eleven weeks, but full recovery followed. For the 
past year he has been less well and strong. Last winter he went to 
Bermuda, gaining in every way and thirteen pounds in weight. Five 
weeks ago he drove a pair of pulling horses over forty miles. The next 
day he had severe pain in his arms, and this has since been his main 
com|daint. The pain extends from the shoulders to the wrists, is 
worse at night, and often requires morphia to secure sleep. Pain and 
a burning sensation in the fingers comes on suddenly at times, waxes 
and wanes. He has kept the bed for about four weeks, sending for his 
doctor first three weelcs ago. He has lost some fiesh. The bowels are 
constipated. Of late there has been some general abdominal colicky 
pain not attributable to laxatives. Fever has been absent. There is 
no cough or prjecordial pain; he lies indifferently on either side, with 
the head low. He is rather pale, with slight icteric hue of the eonjunc- 
tivffi. The pulse is and has been regular, of fair strength and rather 
low tension, 96. The tongue is clear and moist, the gums and teeth 
in good condition. 

Tactile sensibility is perfect. There is weakness in the arms and 
hands, especially in the extensor muscles. This weakness has increased 
notably in the past week. He can button his undershirt and pick up 
a pn from a smooth surface, though with difficulty. There is no dis- 
tortion of the finger joints. 

The cardiac impulse is in the fifth space one inch to the left of the 
mammary line. Percussion corresponds with palpation and shows slight 
extension of dulness on the right of the sternum. In both the mitral 
and aortic areas soft systolic murmurs are to be heard, one transmitted 
into the axilla, the other into the neck. The second sounds are clear, 
the pulmonic sound slightly accentuated. Visceral examination is 
otherwise negative. (Edema is absent. The knee-jerks are obtained, 
though with difficulty. The urine, 44 ounces in 24 hours, contains 
neither sugar nor albumen. The blood is normal. 



. What discEisea are most often diagnoeed as ""tfaeumatism?"" Osteomyelitis, 

neuritis, arthritis defannana, tabes, gall-stooes, trichiniasis, tuberculous or 
syphilitic osteitis, ao 

2. What connection can. be traced betneen the fall and coma of ten jeaia ago 

and the present eymptomsT In all probabilitj', there is no connection at all. 

3. (a) Common causes of muscular weakness? (b) Of muscular paralysis? (a) 

Malnutrition (due to poverty, Btomach or bowel trouble), diabetes, nephritis,

lyzed. (b) Stand before the patient, who bends his arm at the elbow to a 
right angle. Grasp his hand and resist while he tries to draw his hand towards 
his shoulder. If the supinator is sound it will stand out obviously on the 
thumb-side of the arm. 
6. What relations are there between joint troubles and diseases or anomalies of 
the nervous system? In tabes and syringomyelia painless but very destruc- 
tive joint troubles may occur (""Charcot's Joint""). In many chronic joint 
troubles muscular atrophy is exceedingly rapid and the reflexes are in- 

6. What connection might exist between the cardiac and the peripheral symptoms? 

Annmia or toxsmia might be the cause of both. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Pain, muscular weakness (extensors), diminished knee-jerks, and 
colic with no anesthesia or paresthesia suggest neuritis â -especially that due 
to lead. There are no signs suggesting involvement of the brain, cord, or 
muscles (myositis). The cardiac signs are those of a dilated heart, probably 
due to weakness of its muscle. An examination of the urine showed a lai^ 
amount of lead, apparently derived from drinkmg water. The blood showed 
moderate secondary anamia with an unusually large number of normoblasts 
and marked stippling. 

Prognosis: If the source of the lead can be found and the patient protected 
from it, the prc^nosis for ultimatÂ« recovery is good in a case that has pro- 
gressed no further than this, but the cure will take at least a year. 

Treatment: Prevent the ingestion of any more lead. Help the elimination of 
the pioison by giving KI gr. V. t.i.d. for three weeks in every four. Give 
iron and arsenic for the aniemia. Make the hygienic conditions as good as 
poeuble. Keep up the nutrition of the muscles by electricity and massage."
"CASE 18 

Mrs, J., 65, an active, spare, energetic woman. Always well. For 
two years has noticed some dyspncea on exertion. Two weeks ago had 
an attack of dyspepsia with dizziness. This evening she ate a hearty sup- 
per of chopped codfish and potatoes warmed up in pork fat . Immediately 
afterwards she started out for a walk. After walking about a quarter of 
a mile she noticed dj'spncea, which rapidly increased to great distress. 
On reaching a friend's house she had barely strength to. enter. 

When seen twenty-five minutes later, the patient was sitting up. 
propped by pillows. Respiration was from 30-40 times per minute, 
and accompanied by a loud rattle in the throat. The larynx moved 
violently up and down. No pain anywhere. The face was drawn and 
blue, nose pinched, hands and fingers purple, skin cold and clammy. 
The carotids were throbbing strongly, the heart beating tempestuously 
â 140 times per minute. The lungs were full of coarse, medium, and fine 
rales up to the second rib on each side. Owing to the noisy breathing 
no definite information could be obtained regarding the cardiac valves. 

1. Significance of the rattle in the throat? Tracheal rales occur whenever in- 

Qammatory or dropsical fluid accumulateo in the tmcbea, owing to coma or 
to weakneBB which tenders the patient unable to r^ae and expectaratÂ« or 
Bwaltow the fluid. It ia a bad sign, because it means either very deep (and 

therefore serious) coma, or very Severe prostration, 

2. Significance (a) of throbbing carotids; (b) of other cervical pulsations? (a) Throb- 

bing carotids mean violent heart action, low arterial tension, or both. They 
are seen in cardiac hypertrophy from any cause, especially in aortic regurg^ta- 
tion, in nervous persons, 'and in marked annmia. (b) Aneurism, a normal 
subclavian artery crossing a cervical rib, the normal (diastolic) undulation of 
cervical veins, and the systolic venous pulse of tricuspid leakage should be 
remembered. 

3. What further data should be obtained at once? The strength and rhythm of 

the pulse (far more important than its rate), the temperature, the urine. 

4. How is the prognosis influenced by the mode of onset here? Such symptoms 

arising without assignable cause are more serious than their appearance after 
(probable) indigestion and exertion as here. 

6. Evidence against pneumonia here? The onset without chill or pain; the cardiac 
origin of symptoms; the absence of fever, and of signs of solidified lung. 

6, Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The lung signs are those of pulmonary cedema due to weak heart 
action, such as is often brought on by slight indigestion and exertion is an 
elderly person whose myocardium is weak. Bronchial asthma might produce 
similar pulmonary signs, but practically never occurs at the age of 65 in a 
person previously well. Renal asthma rarely has so sudden an onset without 
previous evidences of unemia, dropsy, or cardiac weakness. 
Prc^oais; Dubious. Death may occur within a tew hours. She will probably 

get over this attack and succumb later to increasing heart weakness. 
Treatment: Absolute rest; vigorous subcutaneous cardiac stimulation (musk, 
strychnia, nitroglycerine); encouragement."
"CASE 19 

A middle-aged man was Been writhing in intense pain referred to 
the epigastrium. Vomiting .of greenish fluid took place; there were 
loose discharges from the bowels, small in amount. This state of things 
lasted, with only short remisaiona, for two days, until a small dose of 
morphia (which, for special reasons had been hitherto withheld, though 
asked for) was administered, after which there was complete relief for 
many days. The pupils were dilated, the pulse regular and of normal 
character. Nothing special had been eaten or drunk to cause irritation 
of the stomach. The abdominal walls were neither distended nor 
retracted, no intra-abdominal tumor wa^ detected, nor was there 
excessive tenderness on pressure. It was afterwards learned that he 
had had several such a^cks, that for many months or years his legs 
had been weak, that he^d had neuralgia and numbness in them. 

1. What further examiimtioiu ehould be made? Pupillaiy reactions, knee-jerks, 

temperature, heart, lunga, blood, and urine are the most important. 

2. If you had seen such a. case for the first time, what treatment of the acute ejrmp- 

toms should you advise? Morphia aubcutaneously. 

3. Significance of the vomiting of greenish fluid? Violent or prolonged vomiting 

from any cause, e,?., from aea^ckneas, squeezes bile into the duodenum whence 
it regurgitates into the stomach and is vomited. 

4. Diagnosis? Pn^piosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The epigastric pain is probably not in^mmolon/ in origin (peritonitis), 
since there is no excessive tendemess or rigidity, ajid a small dose of morphia 
^ves relief for many days. Lead colic is not often associated with diarriioea, 
while the pulse usually shows increased tension. Evidences of plumbism and 
the possible sources of lead should be searched for. Biliary colic cannot be 
excluded without further evidence. A history of jaundice and of radiation 
of pain to right scapular r^on should be sought for. 

The weakness, pain, and numbness of the legs suggest either neuritis (perhaps 
due to lead) or tabes. Examination of the pupils showed no reaction to light, 
although the reaction to distance was normal. The knee-jerks were absent and 
Romberg's symptom present. The acute epigastric pain was explicable as 
a gastric crisis in tabee dorsalis. Morphia had been withheld because the 
patient had in previous years narrowly escaped the habit. No evidence of 
lead or of gall-stones could be obtained. Other causes of epigastric pain of less 
severity than that here described are gastric xilcer and kypercM^kydria (in 
which the pain has more obvious relation to food than in this case), malaria 
(periodic pain with fever), gastro-enteritia, in which the shifting of the pam 
and its relation to food and to bowel movements are usually obvious. 

Prognosis: Most cases of tabes live many years and gradually get worse. Arrest 
is possible but rare ; cure is impossible. 

Treatment: Fotassic iodide and mercury should be given, though they are 
rarely of service. By re-education (Frtenkel) the patient's muscles may be 
again brought under control to a remarkable extent after ataxia appears. 
Hot baths and analgesic drugs are used for the crises and pains."
"CASE 20 

A married womac, aged 27, is seen June 7. Both parents died of 
consumption. She has always been well except for an attack of 
rheumatic fever three years ago. Has had four healthy children, the 
youngest six months old. Her oldest child was taken with convulsions 
on the night of June 2 and died twelve hours later. After his death 
she seemed dazed and became delirious, but had intervals of apparent 
consciousness up to 6 p.m., when she complained of pain in the back 
of her neck and began to vomit. Vomiting was frequent and persistent 
until the following evening. She has remained unconscious since the 
evening of the 3d. Yesterday morning her hands and feet appeared 
swollen and inflamed. Her temperature has varied between 101Â° and 
102.5Â° and has been irregular. Her pulse is 120, respirations 30. She 
is delirious, and does not appear to realize her surroundings. Both 
knee and ankles, the back of the left hand and the metacarpo-phalan- 
geal joint of the right index finger are red, swollen, and tender. There 
is redness over both patellfe. The muscles of the calves and thighs 
are tender. The neck is somewhat stiff, the pupils dilated, and there 
is divergent strabismus. The knee-jerks are not obtained. Except 
for a few moist rales at the bases of the lungs physical examination 
otherwise negative. The white cells number 29,400. Urine, sp. gr. 
1030, acid, albumen very slight trace, sugar a trace. Sediment 
contains occasional hyaline and fine granular casts and a rare abnor- 
mal blood globule. The amount is 500 c.c. 

1. What dionges mi^t be reveaJed by^ ophthaJmoacopic examinaticm? Optic 

neutitiB, choroid tubercles (veiy rare). 

2. IKscuBS the urinary anomalies in this cÂ«ae7 Passive coagestion and the acutÂ« 

degeneration resulting from any infectious fever are the commooest causes 
of such urine. The glycosuria is probably due to cerebral irritation. 

3. What are the most important types and causes of ari^lmtis7 (See above, Case 3.) 

4. Name three causes of strabismus? Congenital, tuberculous meningitis, syphilis. 

5. What tÂ«sts would simplify the diagnosis? Spinal puncture, ophthalmoscopy. 
(1. How is the vomiting to be explained in tbte case? The onset of an infectious 

disease. Other causes of vomiting may here be discussed. 
7. Diagnods? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnous: At autopsy tuberculous meninigitia aQd general miliary tuberculosis 
were found. The family history, the sudden onset of fever, coma, delirium, 
retraction of the neck and strabismus, maiie this diagnosis obvious. The pains 
in the peripheral joints and muscles are to be explained as a part of the 
general infectious process, though in all probabilty no gross tuberculous lesions 
were present there. The type of meningitis would be revealed by spinal 

Prognosis: Probably early death. Recovery is practically impossible here. 
Treatmenti To prevent bed-sores, maintain nutrition, and relieve headache 
(should it occur) l^ lumbar puncture and morphia, are the chief indications." 
"CASE 21 

A painter, 23 years old. Family history negative. General health 
always good. Clap eight months ago, a slight mucopurulent dischai^e 
etill persisting. Seven months ago had an attack of colic, lasting three 
or four days, similar to his present trouble, but less severe. Bowels 
move once daily without medicine. Seven days ago began to have 
cramps which have grown rapidly worse since and have been only 
partially relieved by large doses of morphia and atropine. The abdo- 
men at first was generally tender, especially just to the right of the 
navel. The bowels have been constipated from the start, in spite of 
repeated doses of salts and enemata. Very little gas passes per rectum. 
Has vomited three times, the vomitus containing nothing of note. 

Physical examination shows a poorly nourished man, suffering 
acutely from general colicky, pains in abdomen. Expression pinched, 
anxious. No jaundice. Faint blue line on gums. Radial arteries 
slightly thickened. Heart and lungs normal.' Abdomen distended, 
and tympanitic. Between the attacks of pain no marked tenderness 
is elicited even on fairly deep pressure. The distended, moving coils 
of intestine are visible through the thin walls, which are somewhat 
rigid everywhere. The finger high up in rectum strikes a tender point 
a little to the right of the median line. The pulse is small, 120, and 
has been steadily rising. The temperature, taken only during the past 
five days, has never gone above 99Â°. Urine scanty, high colored, acid, 
sp. gr. 1026, No sugar, no albumen. Sediment negative. Leucocytes 
five days ago 35,000, now 19,000. 

1. Commoa cauaeB of oligurisi? ObatructiOD (proatatic, cancerous, or calculous), 

nephritis, infectious fevera, starvation (including pyloric obstruction with 
gastric dilatation), vomiting, diarrhiEa, sweating, low protÂ«id diet, hysteria. 

2. How does the temperature record influence our diagnowa here? By itaelf it 

would incline us to believe that no inflammatory process is going on. 

3. Significance of the leucocytosis here present? Uncomplicated plumbiam never 

produces such a leucocytosis; intestinal obstruction rarely if ever raises the 
count to 35,000. A focus of inflammation is probably indicated. 

4. Have the thickened radials uiy connection with the other symptoms of this 

case? Lead poisoning the patient certainly has. Lead is said to produce 
thickening of the arterial walls. 
6. What organs and tissues are injured in plumbism? The gums, the blood, the 
nerves supplying the extensors, the brain, the arteries, the kidneys, the gastro- 
intestinal tract (colic, constipation). 
6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Operation showed genend peritonitis due to appendicitis. The 
purgation probably did great harm. The obvious presence of plumbism 
led to a disastrous mistake in diagnosis. 

PrognoBis; Very grave, in view of the absence of any evidence of localization. 

Treatment; Immediate surgical interference." 
"CASE 22 

A lawyer, aged 68, has always worited hard, and for the past three 
years had great anxieties and no vacation. He had typhoid fever 
twenty years ago and obstinate sciatica two years ago, since which 
time he thinks he has lost weight. He smokes a good deal and drinks 
wine in moderation. He now complains of dyspepsia (without vomit- 
ing), constipation, dyspncea, impaired vision, and pain in the right 
shoulder. For at least ten years he haa looked pale. Now he looks 
very pale, and sallow. The tongue is clean, the pulse soft and regular. 
At the apex, which is in the fifth space in the nipple line, there is a 
faint systolic murmur, transmitted a short distance to the left. The 
pulmonic second sound ia accented. No enlai^ement to the right. At 
the base of the lungs, posteriorly, moist rales are heard on full inspira- 
tion. The liver is not enlarged. There is moderate tenderness in the 
left epigastrium. On bimanual examination, a rounded mass can 
be felt, moving with respiration, about three inches below the right 
costal border. 

The urine contains about -^ per cent albumen and a tew hyaline 
and granular casts, some of which display a little fat and crystals of 
uric acid. The total amount in twenty-four hours is one quart, with 
a specific gravity of 1015. The blood shows no leucocytosis. Red 
cells very much reduced in number. The painful shoulder presents no 
objective peculiarities. 

1. Significance of rales? Hales mean fluid in tbe bronchioles. Tbey are due to 

bronchitis (""simple"" or tuberculous), asthma, pneumoaia, atelectasis (inflam- 
matory or dropucal), and cedema of the lung. 

2. What further information about the rounded mass is desirable? Size, shape, 

surface, consistency, tenderness, dulness, relation to liver, relation to in- 
flated stomach and colon, general mobility. 

3. What other portions of the examination are insufficiently described? The blood, 

lungs, eyes, and urine. 

4. How do you interpret the presence of urie acid crystals in the urine? They 

have no known Ngnificance unless massed to form calculi. 

5. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The objective signs are an abdominal tumor, anemia, and lenal 
irritation. Cancer of the stomach or gut, chronic nephritis, and pernicious 
anfemia are the possibilities most deserving further study. The mass mi^t 
be a distended gall-bladder. It showed, however, when palpated in a warm 
bath (discuss its use), all the characteristics of a displaced normal kidney. 
The blood showed 1,000,000 ted cells, a low white count and high color index, 
with abundant megaloblasts. The aortic second sound was never accentuated 
and the urine never presented the full picture of any type of nephritis. 
The rales in the lungs were doubtless due to cedema; the heart murmur was 
""hfemic."" Retinal examination showed hemorrhages. The diagnosis of per- 
nicious aniemia was later confinned at autopsy. 

For Prognogia and Treatment, see above. Case 4."
"CASE 23 

Man, 50 years old, a hard drinker, except during the past year. 
No family history obtained. For two or three years he has had pain 
after taking food, occasional vomiting and progressive loss of flesh and 
strength. For the past eight or ten weeks he has complained of fre- 
quent and severe pain qi a. ""stretching"" character in the right hypo- 
chondrium, without much tenderness there. For the last two weeks 
he has been deeply jaundiced. For a week he has been confined to 
bed and is emaciated and prostrated. His nights are disturbed by 
pain. The liver is greatly enlarged, hard, irregular, and nodulated, 
the lower edge reaching to the anterior spine of the ilium; it abo 
extends to the left of the median line about two inches. It is 
slightly tender. There is little or no ascites. Pulse 92; temperature 
98.5Â°. Urine rather scanty and very dark. No itching of skin. 

1. What diaeasee can produce emadation with jaundice? Gall-etones and their 

results, cancer obetnicting the biliaty passages, syphilis of the liver, cirrhosis, 
septicemia (toxemic jaundice). 

2. Common causee of hepatic enlargement? Passive congeation, biliary obetruc- 

tion from any cause, fat, cirrhoeis, cancer, rickets; rarer causes are abscess, 
leucsmia and peeudaleucemia, cholangitis, amyloid, and hydatid disease. 

3. What importance would there have been in a good famify history? None in 

this case. (The diseases in which the family bistoiy m of value may here be 
emphasized.) 

4. Diagnosis? Pn^nows? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Gaatric symptoms, nodular hepatic enlargement with severe pain, 
enuiciation and jaundice, and without evidence of portal stasia (ascites, etc.), 
point strongly to cancer of the liver, probably secondary to gastric cancer. 
The history of alcoholism and the hepatic enlargement suggest cirrhasit, but 
there is rarely if ever so much pain in cirrhosis (or indeed in any liver disease 
except cancer), and the ""hobnails"" of cirrhosis are not large enough to make 
the liver feel ""irregular and nodular"" throu^ the abdominal wall. The 
absence of ascites ia alao againat cirrhoais. Syphilid of the liver might produce 
all the signs described and can only be finally eliminated by the therapeutic 
tÂ«st, but the amount of pain here present is almost unknown in syphilis and 
the amount of hepatic enlargement ia very unusual. 

Prognosis: Hepatic cancer usually kills within a year of the discovery of its 
presence. 

Treatment: 'Hie relief of symptoms as they arise is all that can be hoped for if 
the diagnows is correct, but in all cases of hepatic cancer KI should be ^ven 
in doses of 10 to 30 grains daily \mtil it is proved to be valueless. I have 
known a patient die of hepatic syphilis untreated, because her physician was 
sure that it was cancer and had given up hope. The same is true of cirrhosis. 
All cases should be given KI and the benefit of the doubt whether our diag- 
nouB ia conÂ«ct. The itching which may torture the patient in such cases 
should be treated by alkaline baths or washes, dilute carbolic washes, or vase- 
line."
"CASE 24

A tall boy of 19 is brought to the physician's office by his mother, 
who states that for ten years he has had trouble with his head and with 
his bladder. Usually he has to pass water every two hours in the day- 
time. This summer while he was in the country the intervals were 
longer, three or four hours, and his headache did not trouble him, 
but since the autumn the headache has returned. It is in various 
parts of the head, and goes and comes. 

The urine is sometimes turbid, but never hurts him during micturi- 
tion. Masturbation was rather frequent six years ago, but has not been 
practised since, he says. Hia father's sister and his father's aunt died 
of ""softening of the brain,"" and his mother is anxious about his mental 
condition. Appetite, digestion, and sleep good. Bowels regular. 

Examination shows a rather shame-faced, neurotic boy, very tall 
for his age. Visceral examination is negative. Blood normal. Urine 
1026, slightly high colored, very acid, no shreds. No albumen, no sugar. 

1. What are the bad effecta of masturbaition? In many cases there are no demoo- 

frtr&ble Ul-efFeota whatever. In a few casee the youth aeema to be debilitated 
by it. That it ever produces biaiii disease is very unlikely. It is a symptom, 
not a cause of mental enfeeblement. In niany boys a neurosis is produced 
by the shame and remorse associated with it and by fear of its terrible con- 
sequences as they are (quite falsely) delineated in quack newspaper adver- 
tisements or by friends and parents. This neuroeis entails insomnia, anorexia, 
constipation, emaciation, and may thus bring about a pitiable condition. 

2. Common cauBSB of frequent micturition in youth? Nervousness (especially in 

giris), hyperacid urine, the irritation of a phimotic foreskin or of retained 
smegma, gonorrhcea, cystitis, diabetes (either type). 

3. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diaguoris: When a headache recurs in the autunm (when school begins) after 
disappearing in summer, eye-strain should be suspected and looked for. In 
this case it was found and under proper treatment greatly improved. Mater- 
nal anxiety doubtless contributed considerably to the boy's symptoms in 
this as in so many other cases, and by reassuring her a good effect was pro- 
duced upon the boy. The urinary trouble seemed to be due to hyperacidity; 
at any rate it improved rapidly under the administration of sodic bicarbon- 
ate 3 Bs t.i.d. None of the other causes of frequent micturition mentioned 
above were found in this case. 

Eye-strain, hyperacid urine, and an overanxious mother were apparently the 
causes of his trouble. 

I^Y>gnosis: With removal of these hindrances to normal development the Ixiy 
should rapidly regain his health. No doubt he has outgrown his strength 
and owing to this fact he will need some years to att^ vigor. 

Treatment: The essentials have been mentioned already. Beside correcting 
bis eye troubles, modifying the acidity of his urine, and reassuring his 
mother, one should encourage him to outdoor life, early hours, and nutri- ' 
tious food. No drugs seem indicatÂ«d." 
"CASE 25 

A lawyer of 47, of good family history, and previous health, had 
for many years complained of dyspepsia. He had been noticed to be 
losing flesh for three or four months and to have grown pale. Fre- 
quent headaches, weakness, and shortness of breath on exertion, have 
troubled him. An oculist whom he consulted referred him to his family 
physician, who found pallor, diminished eyesight, fulness of eyelids, in- 
creased pulsation in the neck, dyspncea, and exaggerated heart action. 

The apex was in the sixth interspace, mammary line. The heart- 
sounds were loud, and the valvular sounds at the base were accentuated ; 
respiratory sounds at the base of the right chest behind were lessened, 
and numerous fine moist rales could be heard in lower portions and in 
the anterior margin of each lung. Abdomen negative. There was 
swelling of feet and ankles, and the patient stated that at times his 
hands seemed lai^er than usual. Urine 1011; pale. Albumen, a trace. 
Granular and hyaline casts, and fatty elements were found in consider- 
able number. The patient also mentioned cough, with thin, frothy ex- 
pectoration, and that of late micturition at night had annoyed him, and 
that the quantity of urine voided in twenty-four hours was increased. 

Within three months there was gradual change for the worse, and 
after a day of considerable exposure he had a chill, severe headache 
and oliguria. He was found in bed unconscious, on the third day 
after the chill, and died on the following afternoon. 

1. What wtkB the condttioQ m the lungsT (Edema of both; right hydrothorax. 

2. CauBee of diminiahed respiration below the right scapula? Effuaion (inflam- 

matory or dropsical), thickened pleura, solidification (pneumonic, tubercu- 
loua, cancerous), atelectasis, enlargement or upvrard displacement of the liver. 

3. CauBCfl of painless swelling of both hands? Nephritis, hot weather, trichiniasis, 

obstruction to the superior cava. 

4. Significance of frequent nocturnal micturition? Prostatic obstruction, chronic 

nephritis, nervousness (in women). 
6. (a) Causee for accentuation of the aortic second sound? Art^rio-sclerosis, 

aneurism, high tension in the peripheral arteries (nephritis; excitement). 

(&) of the pulmonic second? Obstruction in the lungs due to mitral disease, 

pneumonia, any chronic lung trouble, pleurisy, and thoracic defonniiies. 
6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Autopsy showed chronic intenrtitial nephritis, cardiac hypertrophy 

and dilatation, general cedema. Death from uremia. Retinal hemoirliages 

had been found by the oculist. 
Prognosis: After retinal hemorrhages are found patients seldom live a year. 

Otherwise the duration of life is difficult to predict. It depends on the 

patient's ability and willingness to undergo proper treatment, the response 

of his organs to such treatment, and the occurrence of complications. 
Treatment: Good hygiene with the avoidance of strain and worry; dry warm 

dimate, such as Egypt; sweating and pui^tion each once or twice a week; 

restriction of liquids and replacement of table salt by sodium bromide."
"CASE 26 

A boy, 14 years old, of gouty family history, complains for a year 
of frontal headache, not very severe but persistent and wearing. Appe- 
tite excellent, but digestion not as good as it has been. Has grown 
suddenly very irritable, having been previously sweet-tempered. He 
has lost fiesh during the year and seems listless and weak. Sleeps well. 
Bowels somewhat costive. Getting pale. Heart, lungs, and abdomen 
negative. Knee-jerks not easily obtained, but gait shows only weak- 
ness. Urine normal color, acid, 1028, no albumen. Sediment negative. 
Temperature 98Â°, pulse 96. No oedema. â  Blood negative. 

1. What po68ible cauaee for the change in disposition? Masturbation, psychosis 

of puberty, bnun tumor, diabetes. 

2. Causes of frontal headache commonest at fourteen? Eye-strain, adenoids, 

frontal sinus disease, malaria, pubescence. 

3. Significance of pallor both in general and in this case? Pallor may mean ancemia, 

but often does not. Deficient skin circulation, congenital or acquired (stokers, 
tewdents in the tropics), is a more frequent cause. Many consumptives tmd 
many neurasthenics aie pate, but few are ansmic. Nausea and faintness 
produce local aiuemia, and of course without blood change. No diagnosis 
of anemia is justified until the physician has seen the color of a drop of blood 
on filter paper (Talquist scale) or on a handkerchief. In this case no amemia 
was present. 

4. IMagnaeis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The careful student of this case will notice first of aU tho loss of 
fieek despite good appetite. This, with the persistent headache and diminished 
knee-jerks, are the obvious physical signs. Eye-strain, adenoids, malaria, 
masturbation, were easily excluded by examination and watching. Further 
questions revealed the fact that micturition was frequent and copious. This, 
with the loss of flesh despite good appetite, suggested diabetes, and the urine 
was found on exammation to contain sugar â (a point omitted in the examina- 
tion of the attending physician and therefore omitted in the above description 
of the case). As the glycosuria proved persistent, the diagnosis of diabetes 
mellitus was made. No acetone or diacetic acid was found in the urine at 
this time. The sugar was 5% ; urine, three quarts in twenty-four hours. 

Prognosis: In a thin boy of 14, a few years of life is all that can be ex- 
pected. The response to diet, the presence or absence of acetone bodies in 
the urine, the weight-curve, are the important factors in prognosis. When 
weight is lost and glycosuria persists despite careful regulation of diet, the 
outlook is ominous. Whenever acetone bodies are present in the urine 
coma is threatened. 

Treatment: A diet of fat and proteid sufficient in calory value, and excluding 
at first all carbohydrates, is the indication. If this banishes sugar from the 
urine it should be persisted in for two or three weeks, provided no acetone 
appears and provided weight is maintiuned or increased. At the end of that 
time, if all goes well (or sooner if it doesn't), one or another carbohydrate 
(bread, oatmeal) in measured quantity should be pven, noting the effect on 
the glycosuria, the acidity, and the weight. A small amount of milk and fruit
may be tried either before or after this if all goes well, and fallowing thÂ« 
three indications above mentioned we cautioualy experiment with different 
amounts of carliohydrate food â resting the sugar-burning function from time 
to time by a day of complete starvation (in bed with bouillon only) or a few 
weeks of fat-proteid diet. To increase fats (butter, cream, cheese, salad-oil, 
bacon) is aa important as to exclude carbohydratÂ«s. No food â not even 
meat â is to tÂ« allowed in unlimited quantity. Saccharine replaces sugar aa 
a sweet. If appetite fails, give fruit mitil it returns. Moderate exercise 
distinctly beneficial even in severe cases. In adults small quantities of alcohol 
may be used to increase the calory-value of the blood and help the digestion 
of fats. Drugs (except for constipation, insomnia, etc.) are valueless. In 
fat old patients all the above rules are to be applied in a modified form. A 
restriction of carbohydrates often suffices."
"CASE 27 

Young salesman, always well till present illnesa. Family history 
good. Worked hard last winter and worried. Frequent beadachee, 
indigestion, insomnia. Feeling poorly for several weeks, especially at 
end of day, but has worked until week ago; since then, on sofa and in 
bed. Chief complaints, weakness and pain in left chest. Two chills 
this week; slight, dry cough; no nosebleed. Bowels constipated and 
appetite poor. 

Physical examination: Fairly nourished, tongue coated, expression 
bright, no enlarged glands. Heart shows musical systolic murmur at 
apex, heard in axilla and back; action slightly irregular; no enlargement. 
Pulmonic second sound normal. Lungs negative, except over seat 
of pain in side, where was heard a harsh sound synchronous with respira- 
tion for a few breaths and then not heard again. Abdomen shows 
dulness in both flanks, which, however, shows but little shift with 
change of position. Liver dulness from sixth rib to rib-margin. The 
spleen is not palpable, splenic area tympanitic; knee-jerks lively. 
Temperature 99-102Â°, swinging up in the afternoon. Pulse 100-110. 
No sputa; urine negative. 

Blood examination: Reds, 3,200,000; whites, 4000; Hb., 40%. 

1. When ft patient's chief complaint is weakness, what diagnosea Bbould be con- 

eidered? Anieniia, bad hygiene, typhoid, nephritis, endocarditig, myxcedema, 
tuberculoais. 

2. Name five CDinmon causes of pain in the left axilla. Dyspepsia, pleuri^ 

(""simple,"" pneumonic, tutwrculous), intercostal neuralgia, muHcular pain, 
hypertrophic spondylitis. 

3. How should the cardiac murmur be interpreted in this case? Musical murmurs, 

widely transmitted, usually mean endocarditis (acute or chronic), but in the 
absence of any demonstrable cardiac enlargeDient or accentuation of the 
pulmonic second sound, the murmur may possibly be ""functional."" Suspend 
judgment. 

4. What adventitious thoracic sounds are most likely to be fugitive, as in this 

case? Rales, especially musical rales, friction sounds, pleural or pericardial. 

5. Significance of the leucocyte count in this case? It makes septic endocarditis 

or any other form of sepsis very unlikely. 

6. General significance of normal or subnormal leucocyte counts? Their presence 

in typhoid and malaria makes them very valuable in cases where either of 
these diagnoses is being balanced against a possible pneumonia, meningitis, 
or septiceemia. Primary anKmias have normal or subnormal leucocyte counts; 
some secondary anemias show leucocytosis. Most cases of abscess (appendix, 
liver, etc.) raise the leucocylÂ« count. Most cases of cancer and uncomplicated 
tuberculosis do not. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Continued fever with chills, amemia, signs suggesting endocarditis 
and dry pleurisy, possibly fluid in the peritoneum, and a low leucocyte count
are the essentials of this case, lyphoid, malignant endocarditis (with or 
mtbout a primary focus elsen-here), malaria and tuberculosis (pleural, peri* 
toneal) are especially to be considered. The question of Toalaria can be 
settled b^ tdood examination. Neither malaria nor typhoid will account 
for the physical wgns in the chest or abdomen. The Widal reaction should be 
tried. Against septic endocarditis is the leucocyte count and the absence of 
embolic phenomena. Blood cultures should be made. In favor of tuber- 
culous are the phyucal signs (apparently) of dry pleurisy and of Suid in the 
belly (perhaps prevented by adheaons from shifting). This diagnosis was 
further supported by the negative blood cultures, the absence of a Widal 
reaction, and of malarial parasites. Operation showed it to be correct. 

Prognosis: About one half the recognized cases recover in the course of many 
months, with or without operation. 

Treatment: If, under treatment similar to that i^ven in phthisis, the patient 
does not improve, surgical intervention is advisable and often proves cura- 
tive. It should not, however, be advised in every case until the failure oÂ£ 
a measures is proven."
"CASE 28 

A broker of 26, moderately alcoholic, but with no venereal history. 
. Has always been well. Been under a surgeon's care for last three dajrs 
for ""grippe"" and taken whiskey and ammonol. On the third day, 
Saturday, he took two whiskies and went to ride. The horse shied 
and threw him. His head struck on a rock, just above and in front 
of the right parietal eminence. Coma for ten minutes; after being 
carried home he vomited and complained of pain in the occiput and 
numbness of the right hand. Temperature 104Â°, the pulse 90. Next 
morning it was 103Â°, next evening 103.8Â°. Monday it was 102Â°, 
pulse 85. The bowels have not moved. Patient has regained con- 
sciousness, but is still dazed. There is no evidence of fracture or 
suppuration anjnvhere, but there is numbness along the ulnar side 
of the right hand. 

Seen Tuesday; very bright, sat up strongly in bed to shake hands. 
Laughed and talked, wants to get up, but temperature still 102Â°. 

1. What are the objections to giving ammonol in thia case? It is a nostrum. 

2. What should you expect to find in this patient's urineT High color and specilic 

gravity, small amount, albumen a trace, a few hyaline and granular casts. 

3. What facts justify the statement: ""There is no evidence of suppuration any- 

where?"" That the classical signs of inflammation (redness, heat, sweUing, 
tenderness, and pain) are absent; that leucocytosis is absent. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The coma, the occipital pain later on, the vomiting and numbness 
along the ulnar side of the right hand, suggest intracranial trauma; but we 
note that the peripheral numbness is on the same side as the (supposed) 
bnun injury. By amlrecoup it is possible to injure the left side of the brain, 
but hardly possible to injure the cortical area corresponding to the small 
patch of peripheral ajuesthesia. The absence of lasting coma, paralysis, or 
obvious injury to the skull make brain injuiy unlikely; but injury to the 
exposed ulnar nerve is natural in such an accident. Fever due to the ""shak- 
ing up"" of the accident would be unlikely to reach 102Â° four days after. 
""Grippe"" should show local lesions (of the respiratory tract or elsewhere), and 
rarely causes a fever reachii^ 102Â° on the seventh day. This continued fever, 
without obvious local leaions, should naturally surest (as it did here) a Widal 
test. This proved positive and the patient went through an attack of typhoid 
typical except for tbe absence of cerebral symptoms or marked prostration. 

Prognosis: The mortality is about 10% ; the duration, four weeks fever, and six 
to twelve months t)efore complete vigor is regained. After that the individual 
is often stronger than before tbe fever. 

Treatment: Bed, hydrotherapy, diet according to digestive power, enemata 
every second day when constipation' is present. Those who believe that the 
heart can be stimulated in typhoid give alcohol, strychnia, and digitalis when 
the pulse becomes rapid, weak and irregular. If hemorrhage occur, food 
should be greatly restricted. Infusion of salt solution may lie i 
For perforation immediate laparotomy is usually advised."
"CASE 29 

Patient a man 55 years old; rather fat; subject to frequent attacks 
of winter cough, with aathmatic tendency. For seven years the heart 
had been noticeably weak and irregular. Puke SO; first sound valvu- 
lar. Apex beat art inch and a half directly below left nipple; no 
murmurs. No previous rheumatism. Several years ago there was 
sudden and complete loss of memory, the same questions being re- 
peated as soon as answered. The expression was at the time rather 
vacant; the pupils were equal and responded to light; there was no 
motor paralysis. The amnesia lasted all day, disappearing the follow- 
ing morning. The pulse remained 50 for two days. The patient had 
been previously very anffimic, and had had much fatigue and anxiety, 
with digestive disturbance. The urine always remained normal. In 
the following years there were occasional attacks of transient numbness 
in the left arm and leg, and sometimes faint turns with pallor and 
irregular, feeble pusle. Headache was a frequent symptom; dyspncea 
on exertion, impaired appetite, and insomnia were constant. There 
was no apparent loss of flesh. In 1897 life was endangered for two 
weeks by cedema of both lungs, supervening on an attack of bronchitis. 
In the subsequent years the condition improved somewhat, so that the 
patient could walk half a mile or more and was able to attend to con- 
siderable business. In autumn of 1904, be had several attacks of bron- 
chitis, and, finally, an attack of complete hemiplegia resulted fatally 
in twenty-four hours without recovery of consciousness. Respiration 
was of the Cheyne-Stokes type, and later stertorous. 

1. Significajice of etertoroiu reepiratioD? Any deep coma (even deep, healthy 

sleep) may produce it. 

2. What is meant by an aathmatic tendency â t'.e., on what physical signs should 

such a diagnosis be based? Squeaking and groaning rales present on slight 
exertion or excitement, with or without typical asthmatic paroxysms at long 
intervaJs. 

3. What are the relations ot bronchitis and other pulmonary lesions to disease of the 

heart? (a) Chronic bronchitis may lead to emphysema, and this to hyper- 
trophy, dilatation and weakening of the right ventricle with tricuspid leakage. 
(j>} Mitral disease may favor the occurrence of bronchitis and pneumonia of 
various types. Intracardiac thrombosis, occurring in weakened conditions 
of the heart from valvular or myocardial disease, may result in pulmonary 
embolism. Septic or bland emboli are occasionally washed into the lungs 
from vegetations on the tricuspid valve. The rare lesions of the puhnonary 
valves involve malnutrition of the lungs and (in one case known to me) fre- 
quent attacks of pneumonia. Phthisis and endocarditis rarely coexist. 

4. Diagnosis and Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The brain and heart seem to be the organs chiefly affected. In a man 
of 65, weak, irregular heart and pulse, with dyspncea on exertion, but 
without murmuis, are usually expUiued as reeulta of coronair sclerosia and 
mjrocarditis. The ""aathmatic tendency,"" obetructii^ the puhnaiiBii7 circu- 
lation and so increasing the work of the right ventricle, probably contributÂ«d 
to weaken the heart. The acme of cardiac weakness (Miused the pulmonary 
oedema in 1897. The amneaia with bradycardia, the hemipartestheuie and faint 
turns, and the tenninal coma of hemipl^pa, are results of cerebral arterio- 
sclerosis with final hemorrhage. No other diagnosis is plausible, provided 
the urine remained normal and provided syphilis can tie excluded. 
Treatment: The advance of arterio-sclerosis can perhaps be checked if life is 
lived at a slower pace, avoiding strains of all kinds and following strictly the 
laws of hygiene. Small doses of KI and of nitroglycerine are pven by most 
good piuctititners for long periods."
"CASE 30 

A. R,, aged 50, waa seen June 3, He had always been troubled with 
constipation, his bowels moving only once or twice a week. For five 
weeks he had had epigastric [lain, which for three days had been 
severe. He had had no movement of the bowels, no chills or fever. 

Physical examination showed a thin, wom-Iooking man. The pulse 
and temperature were normal, the tongue clean and moist. Hia chest 
showed diminished breathing throughout the left chest, broncho-vesi- 
cular respiration and dulness at the right apex, and numerous rales 
throughout this side. The abdomen was distended. There was dul- 
nees in the left hypochondrium, with marked tenderness and muscular 
spasm. Elsewhere there was tympany. 

A high enema relieved him of large masses of scybalce and made 
him more comfortable, but on June 10 there was stUl a tender mass 
in the left hypochondrium. Temperature 99,6Â°, pulse 90. 

1. In what way and to what extent should the patknt'e age and the condition of 

hie chest influence our decision as to an operation? The signs are strong 
suggeetive of phthisis; if this is CMifiimed by sputum examination, the risks 
of operation, eq^ecially in a man of 50, are considerable. Nevertheless, the 
risk of Tiot operattTtg may be greater. 

2. What is a high enema? How and with what materials should it be given? 

A high enema is one which reaches above the rectum for a greater or smaller 
distance. It should be given with soft rubber tube passed up as high as it 
will go, ""with the patient on his left ^de and the hips laised. Warm suds pre- 
ceded by warm oil may be used. 

3. Importance of the temperature and pulse here? If they remain low and with- 

out leucocytoeis, the danger of spreading peritonitis or of active abecess is 
not great, 

4. What other data should be known? The condition of the sputa, blood, urine, 

arteries, and heart. 

5. Diagnoua? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnons: Phthisis was proved by the sputum examination. Duhiess, tender- 
ness, 3nd muscular spasm in left hypochondrium unrelieved by high enemata, 
point to a localized peritonitis. This might be excited by ulcer or cancer 
of the stomach or colon, or by abscess of the spleen (very rare). The intestinal 
sjTnptoma are not as marked as they are apt to be when ulcer or cancer of 
the colon have passed their long period of latency and make themselves felt. 
The stomach seems likely to be the source of the peritonitis, but further 
than this we cannot go. Ulcer is more apt to perforate than cancer, but can- 
cer is commoner at this age. Operation showed a perforation of the anterior 
wall of the stomach near the cardia, with adhesions to the abdominal wall. 
No pus or general peritonitis. 

Prognosis: It is hard to see how such a case could recover without operation. 
With operation, the majority of such coses do recover, though little is yet 
known about the permanency of their relief. ' 

Treatment: The ulcer was infolded and a posterior gastro-enterostomy done. 
The patient lived six months and his death was due apparently to phthisis."
"CASE 31 

Mrs. A., a Jewess of 36, has been suffering for six months with pain 
in her left side. At the beginning of the period a small lump appeared 
in the left breast. It was pronounced cancer by a competent sur- 
geon and immediate removal was advised, but in three da3rs it had com- 
pletely disappeared and has not been seen since. From that time to 
the present she has had pain of gradually increasing severity throughout 
the left side of her body and in the back of the head. When the attacks 
of pain come she feels flushed but looks pale {sometimes with red spots 
on the face), and has ""electric feelings"" in the chest which are some- 
what relieved (as is the pain) by pressure with the hand. 

The pain is most apt to come on at night and sometimes keeps her 
awake or checks speech. There is a constant sense of pressure at the 
root of the nose and a beating in the head. 

Her appetite is poor and there is often ""bloating"" after meals. 
The bowels are costive and she is nervous. 

In the past three months, since a vacation in the country, with a 
good deal of exercise, she has decidedly improved, and now has the pain 
not more than an hour or two a day. The day after a good night sweat 
(which she has occasionally) she feels much better. She thinks she has 
lost about six pounds in weight. 

Physical examination (including blood and urine) is negative. 

IKagnods : The dictum of the competent hut^cod had impressed itself with such 
force upon the mind of this neurotic Jewess that she could not rid herself 
of the idea of cancer, somewhere, internal it not external. The wide area 
over which pain is felt (head, chest, leg), the vaso-motor symptoms and par- 
Eeetbeeiie, the relief by vacation in the country with relativelj' good hygiene, 
and the improvement after sweating, all point to a jear-newomx as the chief 
cause of her symptoms. No doubt the constipation and dyspepsia play a 
considerable part in her sufferings. Of course the negative results of phj^cal 
examination are most important as eonfirroatory evidence of the neurotic 
baas of the symptoms, 

Prognoda; No complete cure is often accomplished in a neurotic Jew, but con- 
udeiable improvement should result from effective reassurance and good 
hygiene. Life and useful activity should not in any case be considerably 
curtailed. 

Treatment: After a thorou|^ examination one should do one's beat effectively 
and convincingly to reassure the patient. This will proiiably take many 
sittings but can probably be accomplished, and is the sine qua non of any 
considerable relief. In this case it gave great relief. The digestive symptoms 
should next receive attention, and taking a hint from the relief in the pre- 
vious summer vacation we should try to secure something tike the same con- 
ditions. Massage, hydrotherapy, and proper exercise, with fresh air, regular 
nutritious meals, and encouragement, will help much. Enemata may be 
needed for the bowels from time to time."
"CASE 32 

A manufacturer, 35 years old, is seen May 28. His father and 
siater died of phthisis, otherwise the family history is negative. While 
never strong he has been able successfully to attend to a lai^e and 
exacting businesa. Three years ago he suffered from sestivo-autumnal 
malaria. Since then he has been treated several times tor malaria. 
Last December he began to feel run down, but kept at work until the 
latter part of March, when he went South to recuperate and remained 
there two weeks. His appetite and strength improved, but on bis 
return, April 8, after an elaborate dinner, he complained of nausea 
and flatulency and felt feverish. He went to bed where he has since 
remained. He has vomited occasionally, and has had a half dozen 
loose movements a day, nearly black in color, probably the result of 
bismuth which he has taken frequently. During the last three days he 
has noticed a slight dry cough. The temperature chart shows a wave- 
like curve. Every nine or ten days the morning temperature is normal, 
where it remains for from one to four days. It then gradually rises 
for four or five days to 102Â° or 103Â°, and as gradually falls. The 
evening record follows the morning curve closely, but has rarely gone 
below 100Â°, The temperature is always higher at night, and often 
during the periods of morning apyrexia rises as high as 103Â°. He has 
lost greatly in strength and flesh. 

Physical examination shows a man much emaciated and weak, 
Sensorium free. Both cheeks are slightly flushed. There is dulness 
over the left front down to the third rib and in the left supra-spinous 
region, with broncho-vesicular respiration, increased voice sounds, and 
numerous high-pitched, moist rales at the end of inspiration. The 
heart sounds are normal. The hard smooth edge of the spleen is felt 
two inches below the ribs. Liver is normal. Abdtmien is distended, 
tympanitic, somewhat tender everywhere, but especially in right 
ihac fossa. Pulse 112, weak and thready. Respiration 24. Leuco- 
cytes 12,000. Widal is positive in dilution 1-60, but not higher. 
Blood culture shows no growth. Examination of the stools showed 
bacillus of tuberculosis, B, typhosus, B. colicommunis, streptococcus 
pyogenes, staphylococcus pyogenes albus. Urine 1018, acid, slight 
trace of albumen, a few hyaline and fine granular casts, amount 60 oz. 

1. How can the lung signs be explained in view of tlie fact that there has been 

but three days' cough aDd no sputa? Acute phthisis may produce no cou^ 
or sputa; the same is true of pneumonia, but the picture is more lilce phthieis. 

2. Would further testa help the diagnosis? No; the data given are sufficient. 

3. How do you interpret the Widal reaction in this case? As evidence of typhoid. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Tuberculosis and typhoid are proved by the data in the stools. 
Prognosis; Hopeless. Treatment; Sj'mptomatic."
"CASE 33 

A married lady of 57, with a grown family of healthy children, began 
about three years ago to suffer from general headaches, during which 
she could understand and answer questions, though memory of what 
was asked and replied was lost. These headaches recurred irregularly, 
each attack lasting twenty-four hours or more. Two years ago her 
physician suspected myxcedema, and great improvement in all respects 
followed the taking of thyroid. The dosage was diminished and for 
some months back she has taken only two or three grains a day. 

About one month ago headache, more constant and less severe than 
formerly, came on, and she failed in general health and strength without 
any definite symptoms other than the headache. Six days ago she 
began to get stupid and within twenty-four hours was in deep coma, 
in which she still remains. There is incontinence of urine. The bowels 
have not moved for several days. Two days ago the pulse, respiration, 
and temperature were all normal at 6 a.m. Between that hour and 
9 A.M. the pulse rose to 110, respiration to 30, and temperature to 
103Â°, remaining elevated ever since. Soon after the advent of coma the 
thyroid extract was increased to 15 grains three times a day. Until 
within twenty-four hours she has taken food fairly well. Pulse 130, 
regular, respiration 36, temperature 102.8Â°. Lies on back with flaccid, 
non-Â«ensitive limbs; sides of face equal; pupils equal, moderately con- 
tracted, responding slightly to strong light stimulus; all other reflexes 
absent, except the plantar. The eye fundus is negative. Visceral 
examination is negative, except for dulness, bronchial respiration, and 
fine rales over the right lower back. The leucocytes are 23,000 per 



1. What is the condition of the right lung? Pneumonia, probably of the hypo- 

stfttic type. 

2. If BabiuBki's reaction were present on one side, would your diagnosis be modi- 

fied? (See question 4.) 

3. Significance of the mode of onset in this case? A gradual onset of coma is 

against cerebral bemorrfiage or embolism. 

4. What can be inferred from the absence of focal c^mptoms? That there are 

probably no lesions in the motor areas. The whole brain is probably affected 
to some extent. 

5. IKagnoMs? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Cerebral tumor or abscess is possible, but the absence of focal symp- 
toms, and especially of choked disk, are agamst these diagnoass. Unemia 
could explain all the symptoms, but the urine showed no characteristic 
changes.* The thyroid treatment could not by itself produce such symptoms. 
The fever and leucocytosis make it needful to consider meningitis, but the 

he case Biven by Ihe altendipc pfaysidan^, hence ii 
1b omined in ih ^ ' 
gradual onset and the abaenee of choked disk and of cnnial nerve symptoine 
are against it. Kemig'a sign is apparent^ absent (flaccid limbs); in meningitiB 
it is usually present. Cerebral arterio-acleroeiH, with or witliout syphilis and 
with or without definite foci of softening, seemed on the whole most likely. 

Autopsy showed a ""worm-eaten"" and greatly thickened cranium, with two 
foci of softening, narrowed cerebral arteries and amyloid spleen and kidneya. 
Hypostatic pneumonia on the right. 

Prognosis; Casee presenting similar symptoms have recovered under vigorous 
antisypbilitic treatment (subcutaneously). 

Treatment; Iodine and mercury subcutaneously should be tried, though the 
mercury is unlikely to have any effect."
"CASE 34 

The patient is a married woman, age 34, large and fat ia person. 
She has had two children and three miscarriages, the last six weeks 
ago. Otherwise she says her health has always been good, until within 
three or four months; has been in the habit of drinking beer freely, but 
has not been intemperate. For two weeks there has been pronounced 
jaundice, anorexia and bilious vomiting soon after eating; dizziness, 
flatulence, occasional diarrhcea with pain at epigastrium; slight cedema 
of feet and ankles. These symptoms have been increasing. There has 
been no headache and no hemorrhages or chills. 

The tongue was clean, the pulse 80, temperature 97.8Â°. The heart 
and lungs were normal. The liver was much enlarged and smooth. The 
spleen was felt below the ribs. There was no ascites. The urine had 
a sp, gr. of 1017, was of a deep yellow color, and contained a trace of 
albumen and much bile; sediment normal. The blood was negative. 

1. What forms of jaundice need not be considered in this caÂ«e? The toxtemic 

forma can be excluded. This leaves cancer (probably of the pancreas), catar- 
rhal jaundice, syphilis, cirrhoaia. 

2. What can we infer from the smoothness of the liver surface? That cancer of 

the liver is very unlilcely to be present. Cirrhotic elevations and depressiona 
are not often palpable through the belly wall. Syphilis often causes great 
defonnitiee of the liver. 

3. In what types of hepatic enlai^ement is pain a prominent symptom? Chiefly 

in paaaive congestion and in cancer. (Gall-stones may produce much pain, 
but do not often produce demonstrable hepatic enlargement.) In abscess . 
there is no pain until the pus has burrowed up close to the surface bo aa to 
stretch the capsule where lie practically all the nerves of the liver. Cirrhoma 
is larely painful, syphilis often painless. 

4. What are the signiScant points in the past history? The miscarriage (which 

suggests syphilis), the alcoholism (which suggests cirrhosis), the build (which 
suggests gaU^tones). 

5. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Gall-stone in the common duct is possible but unlikely, owing to 
the presence of splenic tumor, the laclc of any intermission in the symptoms 
and the absence of pain, fever, or chills. Catarrhal jaundice cannot be ex- 
cluded, though it rarely leads to much enlargement of the Uver or spleen. 
The points against cancer are the absence of pain, cachexia, or irregularities 
on the hver surface. Syphilis might produce all these symptoms and can 
be positively excluded only by the therapeutic test. Cirrhosis, or the com- 
bination of cirrhosis and fatty infiltration, is the moat likely diagnoaia. This 
accounts better than any other hypothesis for the splenic enki^ement, the 
large, smooth hver and the jaundice. The gastric symptoms would then 
result from passive congestion of the stomach. The course of the case con- 
firmed the diagnosis of cirrhosis. 

Prognosis ; One or two years of lite. 

Treatment: KI until it b shown to be useless, tapping if ascites appears, pos- 
sibly Talma's operation."
"CASE 35 

Mre. M., 30 years old, is Been in consultatioD October 10, 1905. She 
had her first baby five months ago, and foUowing delivery a severe 
albuminuria Cl-i%) without any urinary abnormality in amount, 
apecifie gravity, or color. The attending physician found very scanty 
hyaline casts otherwise nothing pathol<^ical in the sediment. With 
rest in bed and exclusive milk diet the urine became normal in the 
course of five weeks, but after a return to ordinary diet albumen re- 
appeared and she was again on milk diet for period of seven weeks. In 
neither of these attacks was there any oedema or any unemic mani- 
festation. 

While convalescent from this trouble (but after solid food had 
been begun) the patient began eight days ago to have bleeding 
from the gums, from the rectum and subcutaneously. The spots 
imder the skin were , of various sizes, perhaps twenty in all, and 
occurred mostly on the arms and legs. The bleeding ceased in 
two days; it was not accomjranied by subjective symptoms of any 
kind, and the patient feels now quite well though rather weak. She 
is still in bed. 

She looks the picture of health. Her color is bright, there is no 
emaciation. There is a loud, harsh, systolic murmur a,udible all over 
the prsecordia, but best heard in the third left interspace near the 
sternum. The pulmonic second sound is slightly louder than the 
aortic. The heart is not enlarged. The other viscera show nothing 
abnormal. The gums are entirely normal, as they have been through- 
out. A few ""black and blue"" spots still remain upon the extremities. 
The urine is 2i pints in twenty-four hours, Sp. gr, 1030, no albumen, 
no sugar. 

Blood: red cells 3,552,000, white cells 8000. Hemoglobin 55%. 
The stained film shows achromia and moderate poikilocytosis, but 
is otherwise normal. The temperature ranges between 97Â° and 99.4Â°. 
Twice in the last fortnight it has reached 100Â°. 

1. Causes of albuminuns? Pasuve congestion of the ludney, infectious fevers, 

the ""initatioa"" of bile or sugar In the urine, nephritis, renal arterio-acleroais, 
hsmaturia and pyuria from any cause, the iatennisture of vaginal discharges. 
In many cases (orthostatic, adolescent) no cause can be found. 

2. Causes of subcutaneous hemorrhage? Traumatiam, infections (such as mwiin- 

gittB, typhus, sepsb, and the exanthemata), toxic, cachectic, acurvj, arthritic 
purpura, unknown causes (""simple"" purpura, purpura hemorrhagica). 

3. Causes of amemia such as is here described? Hemorrhage, malaria, typhoid 

(rarely), malignant disease, dysentery, chronic suppurations, nephritis, cirrho- 
OB, chlorosis, intestinal parasites. 

4. DiagnosisT Progno^T Treatment? 

DiagnoBia: Puerper&l nephritis ajid the long enauing milk diet accounts for the 
ajiffimia. The heart munnur has the characteristics of a ""hiemic"" or ""funo- 
titxul"" affair. The purpura is probably of the ""simple"" type, i^., it is not 
Bevere or dependent on any known cause. The fever is easily accounted for 
by the aniemia and confinement to bed. The harahneae of the cardiac mur- 
mur mi^t suggest fears that septic endocarditis was present and responsible 
for the fever and hemoniiages, but the position of the murmur, the absence 
of chills, leucocytows, or marked pyrexia make this fear groundlees. 

ftognoeis: The patient should be up and about in a day or two, and well within 
a month (as in fact she was). 

Treatm^t: Nutritious food, sun and freah air, iron."
"CASE 36 

Dentiat, 42 years old, always well until within four days, when, 
after a hard day's work, was taken with a chill, vomiting, and epigas- 
tric pain. Temperature 102Â°. Next day, 99.4Â°, but vomiting con- 
tinued and was so exhausting that a morphia subcut, \ gr. was given. 
Pain not so severe as the night before, but considerable epigastric ten- 
derness. Kept his bed. Temperature 101.4Â° in afternoon. 

On the third day, the one previous to that on which I saw him, the 
vomiting was less persistent and temperature a little lower, but he felt 
very weak and faint, wanted no light or sound in his room, and desired 
to be left alone and not disturbed. Slight tenderness over the whole 
abdomen now developed, with perhaps a little more on the right iliac 
region. Bowels have been moved freely by cathartics each day. To- 
day, feels as if there was a mass in the rectum. Urine very scanty in 
the last three days. It was examined a week ago and found normal. 
There has been no oedema. Has been working very hard of late. 

E^mination: Tongue clean; temperature 99.2Â° at 5 p.m. ; pulse 68, 
good strength. The patient is pale, and looks exhausted and in pain. 
Thorax negative. Slight general abdominal tenderness, not localized, 
but slightly greater in the epigastrium. RÂ«ctal examination negative. 

1. What ii the significance of the mass apparently felt in the rectum? Any rectal 

[rritation may give the feeling as if a mass were present. 

2. Why is the urine so scanty? Presumably because of the persistent catharsis, 

3. What further tests should be made? Leucocyte count, urine examination. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Has he or has he not a locahzed peritonitis â perhaps from appen- 
dicitis? In favor of peritonitis is the initial temperature and the suggestion 
of localized tenderness on the third day. Against it are the absence of local- 
ized tenderness or elevated pulse upon the fourth day, the free movements 
of the boweb, the mental condition, and (to some extent) the temperature. 
The presence or absence of leucocytosis would help to decide the question. 
It is conceivable that a nephritis and ursmia may have declared itself wittun 
the week since the urine was last examined. The photophobia suggests 
meningitis or hysteria, but there are no other data confirming these bints. 
Previous to obtaining a leucocyte count and urinary examination acute iadi- 
geetion, aggravated by cathartics and by fear of appendicitis, seemed the most 
probable diagnosis. Leucocytes and urine proved normal and the diagnosis 
just mentioned became still more probable. The course of the case con- 
Prognosis: He should be well and at work within a week. The malady is trifling. 
Treatment; To convince one's self and then the patient that he has no appendi- 
citis or other serious disease, to stop the cathartics and soothe the rectum 
with an enema of thin cooked starch, to get the patient out of bed and gradu- 
ally increase his diet, are the main indications. Nux and gentian will prob- 
ably help him, also advice about hygiene." 
"CASE 37 

A boy of 14, a new inmate of a reform school, is seized February 18, 
1903, with headache, backache, and fever. His appetite became poor 
but he managed to go to his meals that day. Next day a red papular 
rash appeared scattered over the entire body. On the third day some 
of the lesions began to be pustular, and when he was seen by the writer 
on the fourth day the great majority were distinctly pustular and had a 
hard, shotty feel under the akin. Some were drying up and covered 
with dark red crusts. The fever was continued, ranging between IOC 
and 102Â°. The boy felt decidedly sick, and could take only liquids 
without nausea. Slight headache and general muscular soreness 
persisted. 

The rash was nowhere confluent, and the skin between the lesions 
was normal. The internal viscera were apparently normal, as was the 
blood. The urine showed the characteristics usual in fevers. 

It was subsequently learned that he had taken some cough medicine 
for the ten days ending one week before the present illness began. The 
nature of this medicine could not be learned. There were no other 
cases like this in the reform school. 

1. Commonest causes of generalized pustular eruptions? Acne and furunculosis, 

drug poifloning, chicken-pox, amall-pox. liese common are pustular eczema 
and impetigo conta^osa. 

2. EHagnomsT Prognosis? Treatment? 

IHognodsi The presence of fever and constitutional symptoms makes all of the 
above aEFections unlikely, except varicella and variola. Acne and furunculosis 
do not appear so rapidly, and this is equally true of the eczema and impetigo. 
Our diagnosis practically is between varicella and variola. The constitu- 
tional signs (pain, fever, and digestive disturbance) and the ahotty feel of the 
lesions point rather to variola. Decidedly, and on the whole definitively, 
a^inst variola is the rapidity with which the lesions reached and passed 
their maturity. It is almost unheard of that any part of a small-pox erup- 
tion should have passed through the pustular stage and be drying up by the 
fourth day. The diagnosis of exanthematous infection will never be satis- 
factory as long as it has to rest on the characteristics of the exanthemata, but 
we have at present no more reliable clinical test. 

The fact that there were no other cases in the school was of no importance in 
diagnosis, for the boy had but recently entered it. Drug eruptions are always 
to be remembered in such cases, but it seems very unlikely that any such 
eruption could produce so much pain, fever, and digestive disturbance. 

Prognosis: Varicella in a young boy usually gets well within seven to ten daya. 
Nephritis and local gangrene are rare complications. 

Treatment; Isolation from adults is impori;ant, since in adults the disease may 
be severe. Liquid diet during the fever is usually advisable â oliierwise 
DO treatment is necessary."
"CASE 38 

A woman, apparently about 40, seen at hotel at 6 F.H., unconscious. 
Semi-dilated pupils, equal and responding to very strong light stimulus. 
The face is pale; pulse 90, regular, small, and soft. Respiration is 
shallow, with an occasional deep inspiration. Temperature normal. 
No blood or froth on lips; no odor to breath. No disparity between 
sides of face. Limbs flaccid, but firm supraorbital pressure causes 
motion in one or another extremity, so also firm pinching of leg muscles. 
No reflexes, deep or superficial; no cedema; no glands. Old, white, 
irregular scars seen near root of nose, on forehead and right cheek. 
Physical examination of thorax and abdomen negative. Urine by 
catheter, 1017, acid, no albumen, no sugar. 

In the absence of all friends, the housekeeper states that the patient 
and her husband came there from a neighboring town the evening 
before. The husband was awakened in the night by some noise to find 
his wife unconscious. Later, she vomited, but she has had no convul- 
sion as far as known, either now or previously. 

1. Important causes of comaT Apoplexy (including cerebral hemorrfjage, throm- 

boeiB and embolism), unemia and hepatic toxsmia, diabetes, cerebral concus' 
don and compresdon, sjmcope (fainting), poisoning by opium, alcohol, and 
illuminating gas, sunstroke, epilepe^ (after the seizure), hysteria. 

2. What strong evidence have we against opium poisoning in this case? The effects 

of opium kill or wear olT within ei^t hours. This attack has lasted already 
about eii^teen hours. 

3. What can be inferred from the abolition of reflexes? Any deep coma may abolish 

the reflexes, hence we can infer, from this fact only that the coma is deep. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Unemia, dialietea, and hepatic toxtemia are excluded by the examina- 
tion of the mine, abdomen, and breath; syncope, alcohol, and opium by the 
duraticm of the symptoms; sunstroke, concussion, epilepsy, compression, and 
gas-poisoning Ijy the history of the case. The reflexes are never wholly 
absent, but rather increased in hysteria, which is also unlikely beoause of the 
general muscular flaccidity. Apoplexy (in the wide sense above deflned) is 
apparently the diagnosis. The white scars on the forehead suggest injuries 
from a, fall in epilepsy, also healed syphilitic lesiona. The former explanation 
is ruled out by the history; the latter gives a very natural reason for the coma 
and for the lack of focal symptoms, which in apoplexy of syphilitic orig^ are 
often absent. 

Prognosis: The majority of such cases recover from the attack within a few 
days or weeks, especially if vigorous antisyphilitic treatment is carried out. 

Treatment: Iodine and mercury should be pven subcutaneously as long as the 
patient caimot swallow, later by mouth. Careful nurMng ia essential to pre- 
vent bed-sores."
"CASE 39 

The patient is a man of 35, who has had fever and cough foi 
two weeks. At the onset he had much pain in the front and right 
side of chest, near attachment of diaphragm. Had a chill on two 
successive days and oq the fourth day. No dyspncea; no sputa till 
sixth day, when a scanty, mucopurulent spit began and has steadily 
increased in amount and grown more purulent since. The fever 
has ranged from 101Â° to 104Â°, and at times there has been a good 
deal of sweating and alight delirium. Has taken liquids fairly well. 
Bowels are rather loose, as they have been oS and on for several years. 
No pain anywhere now. 

The man is sallow, dull, and listless; tongue clean. Poorly nour- 
ished. Over lower half of right chest marked dulness, with distant 
bronchial respiration and increased whisper; voice sounds nasal, espe- 
cially near angle of scapula. Fremitus nearly absent. Over upper half 
of lung medium moist rales were heard on the first and third days 
and none on the second. Viscera otherwise negative, except slight 
tenderness and fulness in the abdomen. 

Sputa examined twice for bacilli; none found. 

Urine high colored, acid 1027, trace of albumen, no sugar. 

Sediment: Abundant urates, leucocytes, and squamous cells. Few 
hyaline and coarse granular casts. 

Blood: Red 4,200,000; white 26,000; Hg. 43%. 

1. What points are agUDst the diagnostB of typhoid fever (with Gomphcations) 

here? Typhoid even with lung complications UEuaUy runs its course without 
leucocytosLa. Splenic tumor and rose spots are apparently absent. The Widal 
reaction ebould be tried. If it is absent, typhoid is unlikely. 

2. Significance of nasal voice sounds? This ia ""egopbony"" and occurs oftenest 

in pleural effusion, â sometimes in solidification of the lung from any cause. 

3. What further examination is essential in this case? Puncture of the chest. 

4. Comment on the urinary sediment. In most fevers one sees such sediment; it 

has no diagnostic value. 

6. Common causes of leucocytosis? Infections, local or general, due to coed 
(strepto-, staphylo-, pneumo-, gono-, meningococci) scarlet fever and diph- 
theria, violent muscular exertion, some toxiemias, e.g. uremia and gas- 
poisoning, and any acute organic brain leuon. 

6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnous: Phthisis, imresolved pnuemonia, abscess of the lung, empyema, or 
subdiaphragmatic absceea rupturing into the lung, are the diagnoses most 
deserving consideration. The two negative sputum examinations make 
phthisis unhkely, but do not exclude it. Unresolved pneumonia does not 
produce profuse purulent sputa. The signs and symptoms of the other three 
lesions above mentioned are identical. Abscess of the lung ia rare, and a 
definite cause (such as the inhaling of food or foul material) is usually to 
be found. The same is true of subdiapbragmatie abscess. Empyema not 
iinoommonly breaks through the lung. Heace statietical grounds should 

incline us towards this diagooais. Exploratoiy puncture is the next and 

most important means of clearing up the diagnoeie. 
Prognosis: Pneumococcus empyema, well drained, uauallj; gets well in A few 

mouths. 
Treatment; (a) Puncture: Uiis was done and showed pus containing pneumo- 

cocci; (b) Encision of a rib; free drainage. Becovery under treatment which 

was otherwise hygienic and Bjrmptomatio."
"CASE 40 

A young man of 21 is seen January 10. At the age of twelve he had 
very severe scarlet fever, followed by endocarditis, for the results of 
which he was under medical eare for about three years. Of recent 
years his health has been very good and he has ridden the wheel fast 
and far without inconvenience. Rather more than two months ago he 
went to the doctor's office with a ""cold""; temperature normal. A few 
days later he returned with a temperature of 103Â°, and said be had had 
night sweats. He was sent home, sat about the house for two days and 
then took to his bed, which he has not left since. A four-hourly chart 
has been kept for sixty-two days, and shows & continuous fever, ranging 
from 101 to 104, iisually higher in the afternoon. On the seventh and 
tenth days after taking to his bed he had nosebleed. This he had 
occasionally when well. Cough has been a fairly constant though not 
prominent symptom, and twice has led to vomiting. The bowels have 
been regular with the aid of an occasional enema. Delirium has been 
practically absent. Eariy in his illness there were a few doubtful rose 
spots. The spleen has never been palpable. He has once or twice 
complained of some pain in his shoulders, but has had no other articular 
symptoms. 

The pulse was about 90 at first, regular, of good strength. It has 
lately become irregular and rapid, some of the heart-beats not reaching 
the wrist. Under digitalis, brandy, and strychnia, the pulse has Im- 
proved very much and is now regular, 100. Ever since he took to his 
bed he has been on an exclusive milk diet. The urine is sufficient in 
quantity with a lai^ trace of albumen, granular and hyaline casts, 
specific gravity 1015. 

The patient is pale, lies on his back, is not much emaciated, has a 
clear tongue, and complains only of weakness. 

On physical examination the lungs seem clear. The heart's ""Impulse 
is in the fifth space, half an inch to the left of the nipple. A systolic 
murmur is heard with maximum intensity over the impulse, transmitted 
into the axilla. Inside the left nipple is a doubtful presystolic murmur. 
The pulmonic second sound is accentuated, aortic second sound clear. 
The belly is slightly distended, duller at the flanks than in the centre, 
the dulness and resonance shifting somewhat with change of position. 
The blood shows a moderate leucocytosis and no Widai reaction. 

1. In what diseases do night sweata occur7 Those producing fever, proetr&tion, 

or both: phthisis, syphilis, rheumatism, pneumonia, and typhoid (especially 
in convalescence), septicfemia in all fonns, alcoholism, neurasthenia, and others. 

2. Significance of the cou^ in thia case? The common causes of cough are (a) 

irritations of the upper air passages; (6) any disease of the luuj^i and (c) any 
disease of the heart that produces pulmonary stasis. In this case there are 
no evidences of (a) or of (b). Hence we fall back on (c) pulmonary stasis due 
to the heart lesion above described. 

3. How is your diagnosis afFected by the third (short) paragraph printed above? 

Doctors sometimes conclude from such evidence that no serious disease is 
preseut. This conclusion, however, is quite unjustifiable when the physical 
signs belie it. Hence the importance of accuratÂ« and thorough physical 
examination. 

4. Name three common fevers which may run for weeks without touching normalT 

Typhoid, tuberculosis, septicemia (with or without septic endocarditis). 

5. What further valuable evidence mi^t be obtained from the blood? Blood 

cultures should be made. 

6. Why is the specific gravity of the urine so low? Exclusive and profuse milk 

7. If the spleen bod become palpable, how should the diagnosb have been modified? 

Not at all, since all the diseases to be considered here may produce splenic 



8. What further symptoms might appear which would clinch the diai^oBis? Evi- 

dence of embolism, commonest in the spleen and kidney, rarer in brain, 
extremities, or subcutaneous tissues. 

9. DiagnosisT Prognosis? Treatment? 

IMagnosis: Typhoid after sixty-two days of fever is almost sure to show a Widal 
reaction and no leucocytoeis. Tuberculosis of this duration should show 
more evidence of cerebral, pulmonary, or other local lesions. Pure tuber- 
culous peritonitis would produce the abdominal signs here described, but 
rarely it ever produces such fever and would not account for the cardiac signs. 
Septicemia with septic endocarditis will account for all the facU of the case. 
The ascites was apparently due (like the cough) to heart weakness. The 
acute mitral endocarditis was proved at autopsy to be engrafted (as the pre- 
vious history suggests) upon an old process of like nature. Multiple emboho 
infarctions of the spleen and kidney were present. 

PrognoMs: Recovery has certainly occurred in cases of septic endocarditis,* and 
in the milder forms of this disease is probably not at all uncommon. Even 
in cases as severe as this it is passible but not likely. In any event the course 
is likely to be many months. 

Treatment: If blood cultures reveal a pathogenic organism, an appropriate 
antibacterial serum should be tried. Otherwise the treatment is purely 
supportive and symptomatic.

"CASE 41 

A heavy middle-aged woman ""took cold"" on Saturday and was 
afterward distressed for breath. She was seen on Tuesday evening 
sitting up, breathing with aome difficulty and with a wheeze, chiefly 
with expiration. The face was red but not hvid. She complained 
of pain at the top of the sternum and side of the throat. There was 
expectoration of white frothy mucus and aome tough brown masses. 
The voice was suppressed. The tonsils were not swollen, there was 
no exudation in the pharynx, and the epiglottis was not swollen. The 
pulse was rapid. The physical signs were negative with the exception 
of prolonged exiÂ»ration. Temperature 99.9Â°, 

1. (a) What ate the commoneet causes of pain referred to the stomum? (b) of 

sore throat? (a) Tracbeitia, aathma, weakened or embarrassed heart, aneu- 
rism, mediastinal tumois. (6) FhtuTngitis, tonsillitis, tonsillar abscess. 

2. In what diseases do patients wheeze? Asthma, emphfaema, some cases of 

broQchitis, bronchial or tracheal stenoeis from cicatrix (eyphilis), or from 
preaaure (aneurism or tumor). 

3. Significance of inspiratoiy and of expiratory dyspucea? Inspiratory dyspnoea 

means obstruction in the upper air passages (""croup,"" diphtheria, quinsy, 
post-pharyngeal abaceeB, foreign bodies in the larynx. Expiratory dyspnixa 
is seen chiefly in asthma and emphysema. Mixed forma occur in other 
diseases of the lungs and of the heart. 

4. How mi^t blood examination help in the diagnosis of this case? The absence 

of leucocytosis would help to exclude pnuemonia. 

5. What should you expect to find in the sputum? Nothing of any diagnostic 

significance. (Important sputum findings in other cases may here be dis- 
cussed.) 

6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis; Laryngeal diphtheria, acute laiyngitis with tracheitis and asthma, 
Ludwig's angina, aneurism, and ""central"" pneumonia are the most important 
poesibihtiee. The temperature and the absence of any physical signs on 
the fourth day make pneumonia very unlikely. (This opinion was later 

- confirmed by the findmg of a normal leucocyte count, â a fact which helped 
to exclude diphtheria and deep cervical abscess.) Ludwig's angina produces 
tenderness and swellmg (as well as pain) at the ude of the neck and throat. 
Fever and leucocytosis would be high. Laryngeal diphtheria was excluded 
by laryngoscopic examination, which also demonstrated the presence of acute 
larjmgitis and tracheitis. The piping rales of asthma appeared a few hours 
later (they are often very fugitive), and this, with the negative results of urinary 
examination, confirmed the diagnosis of bronchial asthma. The tough brown 
masses appeared to come from the region of the tracheal bifurcation. 

Prognosis: She should be well within a week. Such attacks often recur but 
are never serious. 

Treatment: Hot steam (with or without tincture of benzoin) inhaled every 
few hours from a large pitcher of hot water will give some relief. Heroin, 
gr, j\ every five hours, will help the cough. Bed and a diet according to her 
digestive power are the only further treatment needed." 
"CASE 42 

A rather nervous gentleman, 43 years old, both of whose parents died 
of cancer, moved from the city to the couatry about a year before his 
present illness began, and became quite active out doors, with benefit 
to his appetite and general health. The winter snows, however, forced 
him to be more sedentary. When first seen in consultation with the 
family physician, who had been called only four days before, he com- 
plained of obstinate constipation. For six weeks he had had darting 
pains in the lower abdomen, worse at night, but relieved by walking.,^ 
The physician had first prescribed a laxative pill, which caused 
pain but no dejection. The next night he sat bending forward in 
pain most of the night, getting relief from an hypodermic of one 
quarter grain of morphia, twice repeated, which v/sls followed by a 
fecal discharge. The bowels were soft, except for resistance corre- 
sponding to the ascending and transverse colon. The next night he 
had an ounce each of glycerine and castor oil, but was worse the 
following day. Some flatus escaped on the day of the consultation, 
but no fecal matter had come away for at least four days. The 
temperature had remained normal. There was no vomiting. 

Physical examination showed a spare man, with an anxious face. 
Rectal examination was negative. The abdomen was distended with 
gas and somewhat tense, but nowhere especially tender. When the 
patient's attention was diverted, the resistance already described could 
be felt. The pulse was not remarkable at first, but after the examina- 
tion it became rapid and feeble, improving again after a little brandy. 

1. What special significance has the effect of the morphia in thb case? When 

morphia produces & fecal movement it doea bo t^ relieving spaem. Such 
spasm is apt to occur above a stricture (cancerotis or other) of the gut. 

2. What can be inferred from the rectal examination here? That there is no ob- 

struction within reach of the examiner's finger. 

3. How do you interpret the absence of vomiting? The obstruction is not com- 

plete (gas pasBcs) and is probablj' low down in the large gut. 

4. Why were his pains relieved by walking? The element of spasm above men- 

tioned may have been helped by walking, as any form of constipation may be. 

5. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Gradually increasing constipation, leading finally to complete stop- 
page of fecal movements, with abdominal distention, pain, and a pulse that 
easily becomes rapid and feeble, all point to intestinal obstruction, apparently 
in the region of tbe splenic flexure of tbe colon, behind which feces are 
accumulated. At his age, and in the absence of any history of previous 
peritonitis or laparotomy, cancer of the bowel is the commonest cause- 
Prognosis: Orave; operation may relieve, but early recurrence is the rule. 
Treatment: Immediate laparotomy, artificial anus; later an attempt to ex- 
tirpate the growth."
"CASE 43 

A busineee maD of 26, of good family history, habits, and previous 
health, is seen in November, 1900, In the latter part of July, after golf, 
which he plays with the left hand down, he suffered during part of the 
night from severe pain throughout the left arm. A month later he had 
a similar attack, not following golf, and the pain then recurred nightly 
after 1 a.m. During the daytime the pain was only occasional. About 
eight weeks ago he began to have ""indigestion"" â i.e., a sensation as if 
food was arrested on its way to the stomach, which, apparently, man- 
aged it well enough after its arrival. About two weeks later a dry, harass- 
it^ cough came on, troubling him most when on his back or right side, 
but also excited by taking food. Soon after this he noticed that the 
veins in his neck swelled up when he stooped over, and he had to have his 
head higher at night. Lately he has had severe night sweats. Pain, espe- 
cially in his left arm, dysphagia, and dry cough are now the most prom- 
inent symptoms. There has been some loss of weight, more of strength. 

He is pale, nervous, and excited. The pulse and respiration are 
normal in the erect position. Lying down causes marked dyspncea. 
Toward the root of the neck on the left side discreet, non-tender lumps 
can be felt, without attachment to or reddening of the skin. Percus- 
sion is dull over the upper sternum, without prominence or pulsation. 
The radiala are a3'nehronous and equal in volume; the pupils are equal; 
there is no tracheal tug. Thoracic and abdominal exploration is other- 
wise negative. So also the urine. The axillary and inguinal glands 
are not enlarged. Hemoglobin 70 %; reds 4^ million; whites 22,300. 

1. What is the significance of pÂ»n which is worse at night? Congestive pain, such 

as that of toothache, of certain headaches and of qrphilitic periostitis, is 
increaaed by a position that bringa more blood to the part. Any relatively 
mild pain is felt more severely at night because of the absence of distraction. 

2. What temperature should you expect in this case7 Slight, irregular fever. 

3. What importance has the age of this patient? Cancer and aneurism are un- 

likely at twenty-six. 

4. IMagno^? Prognosis? Treatment? 

EKagnoMs; Piun in the left arm, dysphagia, dyspncea, dry cough, lumps in the 
neck, duhiess behind the sternum, marked increase of leucocytes, are the im- 
portant data here, and all suggest aneurism or mediastinal tumor. Aneurism 
is rare at 26 years and does not produce leucocytosis or lumps in the neck. 
Hodgkins disease and leucaemia are identical but for the blood. In this case 
the blood showed lymphocytes 65.3%, polynucleara 34% eosinophiles and 
myelocytes each 4%. Lymphatic leuceemia is accordingly the diagnosis. 

Prognosis: Cases with fever usually run a short couise â six months or less. 

Treatment: X-ray exposures may diminish the size of glands and possibly pro- 
long lite. Daily exposure of five to ten minutes over the sternum and 
neck with a bard tube should be continued until there is the faintest sug- 
gesUon of bum. Then the spleen and long bones may be exposed." 
"CASE 44 

A woman of 35, maFried ten years, five children. Has had con- 
siderable womb trouble and been treated for it by local physician. Of 
late, it has been less troublesome. Father died of cancer, mother of 
""a decline."" For a year has had much to worry her, and has been 
running down and getting nervous. Is troubled with sour eructations 
after meals, especially in the morning. Bowels rather costive. Appe- 
tite as good as usual. Lost no flesh. Occasional severe headache, 
frontal and occipital. Sleeps poorly. ""Hot flushes"" frequent. For 
the last day or two (since coming to Boston) has been voniiting a good 
deal of greenish stuS. 

When seen, was drawn and pinched in the face and nauseated. 
Complained of general abdominal pain, but no tenderness could be 
found, and physical examination was negative except a sharply accented 
aortic second sound. At times she was quite hysterical, after which 
she passed a large amount of pale urine. Very nervous, restless, and 
alarmed about herself. No fever; pulse 110. Complained at times 
of headache. Knee-jerks lively; no clonus. Uterus retroflexed and 
bound down with adhesions. 

Diagnows: Increa^g nervousness and debility for a yeas, beadachea, dyspepsia, 

and vomiting, might all be explained aa the conmion portion of hysterical 
women at this age. The association of headache and vomiting (""sick head- 
ache"") suggests EQigraine, and the condition of the uterus might be thought of 
as helping, together with dyspepsia and constipation, to explain these head- 
aches. Such was in fact the diagnosis made in this case, and thereby a serious 
mistake was made. The woman died in three days of uremia. The urine 
by some accident was not examined, but even without that the sharply 
accented aortic second sound should, at her age, have suggested nephritis. 
At autopsy secondary contracted kidneys weie found. 

In this case the hysterical symptoms so impressed themselves on us, that we neg- 
lected a thorough search for organic disease. It is imftortant to remember 
that the combination of headache and vomiting may mean eititer a commoa 
""sick headache"" or a dangerous ursmia. Organic brain disease, tumor, 
abscess, meningitis, are also possible, but there were no focal symptoms or 
choked disk in this case. The high tension pulse, sharp aortic second, and 
abundant pale urine pointed straight to the diagnosis, had we aot been blind 
to it.* The uterine condition in this, as in many other cases, produced no 
symptoms and bad nothing to do with the case. Much harm is often done 
by treating such lesions as disease, instead of letting them alone. 

Prognosb; In such a case, by vigorous depletion (including perhaps venesection) 
urtemia may perhaps be staved off for weeks or even months. 

Treatment: Bleeding and saline transfusion should be tried at once. Next 
day purgation with concentrated magnesic sulphate, followed on the day 
after by a sweat bath. Whichever method produces the best results should 
be repeated from time to time. It often works well to sweat and purge on 
alternate days. Milk diet for a few days is best. 
â¢ 3Â« aba Case 71."
"CASE 45 

A washerwoman, 68 years old, generally healthy, has been feeling 
pooriy for a month and losing appetite. A week ago began to have 
pain in abdomen; at first all over, but later settling in the lower left 
comer. It is worse when she walks, but has not kept her awake until 
last night. She has always been constipated, and the bowels have 
not moved for two days; has eaten little for two days. 

Examination: Emaciated, sallow, tongue coated, breath offensive. 
Temporal arteries stiff and tortuous. Heart dulness reaches to the right 
sternal border and up to the second rib. Apex just below the fifth rib in 
the nipple line. At the ensiform cartilage, a short murmur replacing the 
second heart sound and heard less distinctly elsewhere. First sound 
at the apex very short; heart's action somewhat irregular. Few moist 
rales at bases of both lungs, with slight dulness and diminished breath- 
ing over lower half of left back; voice sounds normal, tactile fremitus 
diminished. Abdomen slightly distended; tender in left iliac fossa, 
where a deep resistance is felt, but no tumor. IJver dulness from 
seventh rib to rib margin. Right kidney palpable. Urine normal color; 
acid, 1017; trace of albumen; no sugar. Sediment: pus, squamous, 
and spindle cells, calcic oxalate and mucus. Knee-jerks not obtained. 
Temperature, 102Â° at entrance to the hospital, normal next day. Pulse 
100. An enema brought away a small movement, very dark in color. 

1. What is the significance of tortuous temporal artÂ«ries7 Nothing, unleea they 

are also rough and bard. All temporal arteries are tortuous. 

2. How do you interpret the dimensiona of the heart in this case? They are Dormal. 

3. How do you explain the murmur^ If the pulse ie collapsing the murmur is 

probably due to aortic regurgitation. 

4. How does the significance of arhythmia in aortic regurgitation differ from ils 

significance in mitral stenoaisT It is much more serious in aortic diaeaae. 
Mitral arhythmia is conaiBtent with years of fair health. 

5. Name three common causes of cardiac arhythmia? Myocardial weakness, 
mitral disease, tobacco. 

6. What sort of pulae should you expect in this case ? A collapsing pulse. 

7. How much can be inferred from the pulmonary signs here described? CEdema 

of the lungs with right hydratborax. 

8. How do you explain the area of liver dulness here given? Senile emphysema. 

9. What does the calcic oxalate mean here? Nothmg, â as ia usually the case. 

10. How is the temperature accounted for? The fatigue and emotion strain of 

entering the hospital. 

11. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: A high enema brought away an enormous amount of feces with 
great relief to all symptoms. Fecal impaction and arterio-Â«cler(Â«is seemed 
to account for all the facts in her case. Sigmoid cancer was excluded by 
the course of the case. 
Prognosis and Treatment; By regular enemata the recurrence of impaction can 
probably be prevented." 
"CASE 46 

A banker, 58 years old, of good family and previom history, of good 
habits except for very rapid eating, is seen May 1st. About a year ago 
his remaining teeth, which were few and inefficient, were extracted. 
False teeth were procured, but he has not been able to wear thenn on 
account of sore mouth, apparently subjective rather than objective. 
His wife states that for at least a year he has not been as vigorous as 
formerly. He says that during the summer his sleep was poor, without 
apparent cause. In June he took a vacation, but returned weaker than 
when he went, complaining of poor appetite and digestion, nausea and 
occasional vomiting. The vomitus was not characteristic. He did not 
gain in the summer and his complexion became sallow, November 15th, 
after drinking moderately of cider, diarrhcea came on; and between 
this date and February he lost fifty-one pounds in weight. Soon after 
this the diarrhoea was cheeked, and since the last of February loss in 
weight has been trifling, though his color and strength have continued 
to fail. His digestion is better, and he takes a fair amount of food. 
His main complaint at present is of weakness, lassitude, and shortness 
of breath on slight exertion. No fever has been noted. Several exam- 
inations of the urine have been made, all negative until a week ago 
when a single specimen showed sp. gr. 1008, albumen ^%, some pus â 
not' enough, it was thought, to count for the albumen â and a few 
hyaline casts. The twenty-four hour amount is not known, but is 
believed by the attending physician to be increased. Pulse 84, regu- 
lar, feeble, and of low tension. Temperature 99,6"". Marked pallor of 
skin and mucous membranes, with a yellowish tinge. Soft systolic 
murmurs are heard in the mitral and pulmonic areas; the heart is not 
enlarged. There is slight cedema of the ankles. Visceral examination 
is otherwise negative. 

1. What chronic dbeases are most prone to appear at 587 Cancer, arterio-sclero- 

ais and its results. 

2. What seems to account for the dian4i(ea? (See diagnosis.) 

3. What is the signiHcance of a urine of low specific gravity? Profuse ingestion of 

fluid, nervousness, chronic intestitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Yellowish pallor, weakness, and dyspncea, with no obvious disease of 
the heart or lungs, suggest grave antemia. The urinaiy abnonnaUties are 
too recent to account for the ^mptoms. Gaatro-intestmal symptoms such 
as are described often occur in ansemia. ""Hie cider bad probably no effect. 
Blood examination revealed typical pernicious aniemia. 

PrognoMS and Treatment. (See above, Case 4.)"
"CASE 47 

A merchant, aged 35, is seea March 30. Has never beeo very rugged. 
Last summer had a cough which peraiated until he went to the moun- 
tains, lately has felt rather better than usual. On the evening of 
March 28 attended an elaborate dinner. Shortly after returning home, 
he had a chill and began to vomit, lobster and mushrooms being noted 
in the vomitus. On the morning of the 29th he complained of nausea 
and violent headache. Temperature 101Â°, pulse 96. Toward noon he 
began to grow stupid and within an hour could not be roused. The 
respiration became rhythmical with occasional intervals of apncea lasting 
twenty-five seconds. The pulse also was rhythmical, varying from 38 
to 108 as extreme limits, the lower rate corresponding to the periods 
of apncea. On the morning of the 30th he had regained consciousness 
but was still dull. Headache much better. Temperature normal, 
pulse and respiration showed a hardly noticeable rhythm. Vomiting 
had not occurred since eleven o'clock the preceding day. He remained 
dull, but could be roused to take interest in his surroundings. Is 
constantly tossing about the bed. At five o'clock in the afternoon, 
his physician noticed that he was absolutely deaf. Examination of 
ears negative. He replied intelligently but slowly to written ques- 
tions, but appeared to have some difficulty in seeing them. For the 
past twenty-four houra he has required catheterization. Temperature 
98Â°, pulse 72, respiration 24, 

Physical examination shows a pale but fairly well nourished man. 
Pupils contracted and unresponsive to light. Head moves freely except 
forward, 'in which direction motion seems slightly restricted. Examina- 
tion of chest and abdomen negative except for a slight systohc murmur 
over the pulmonic area. Knee-jerks lively, but equal. No Babinski, 
no ankle clonus. Patient apparently has full control of all his muscles. 
White cells 16,000. Urine high-colored, sp. gr. 1024, acid, very slight 
trace of albumen, few hyaline and fine granular casts, no sugar. Amount 
in past twenty-four hours, 32 oz. 

1. What is the significance of rhythmic changes in pulse and respiration? Cheyue- 

Stokes breathing, 

2. How do you explain the cough of the previous summer? It may have been 

due to tuberculosis or simply to bronchitis. 

3. What was the use of asking him to answer written queetiona? To test bis 

cerebration. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Ptomaine poisoning, unemia, and menin^tia should be considered, 
The first two do not stitTen the neck or produce deafness. The urine is not 
characteristic of any type of nephritis. The blood and urine are consistent 
with any of the diagnoses considered. In favor of meningitis are the pre- 
dominiiDce of ceiÂ«brftl eymptamB (coma, CheyTie-Stokee breathing, deafness, 
stiffened neek, he&dacbe) in a febrile disease of acute onset. Death occurred 
in three dajrs and epidemic meningitis was found at autopsy. 

Prognoeia: About 75% die within ten days. Deafness and blindness may 
result if recoveiy occim. 

Treatment: Wholly symptomatic and supportive."
"CASE 48 

A married lady of 62 is seen. March 1. The family and previous 
histories are good. Three years ago the left breast was removed by a 
competent surgeon for cancer. Since then her health has been good 
until December 15, 1902, when, for failing eyesight, she consulted an 
oculist, who found detachment of the retina in the left eye. 

About January 1, she noticed that she wa^ short of breath. After 
this she kept very quiet as exertion brought on dyapncea. Dyapncea 
has continued her main complaint, brought on by exertion, but, espe- 
cially of late, often waking her from sleep. About two weeks ago she 
could lie on the right better than on the left side; since then there has 
been orthopncea. She has a slight dry cough, no pain, fever, or vomit- 
ing. Bowels regular. The appetite is poor. Loss of weight has not 
been marked. The pulse is 112, regular. The right chest is dull on 
percussion above, fiat below, with feeble respiration, diminished voice 
sounds, and fremitus. There is puerile breathing over the left lung, 
and a few fine rales in the fifth interspace in front. The heart's impulse 
is in the sixth space, anterior axillary line. The sounds are clear. The 
abdomen is negative; the urine, 1016-1018 in specific gravity, contains 
neither albumen nor sugar; the amount is not known, but thought to 
be normal for one in her condition. There is no cedema. 

1. Name the most important causes of dyspnoea. Cardiac weakness, emphysema, 

pteural effusion, pneumonia. 

2. (a) Significance of orthoprtoea7 (b) In what diseases does it moat often occurT 

(a) Orthopncea means dyepncea so great that lying down causes distress. 
(6) It is oftenest seen in the diseases mentioned above. 

3. Causes of displacement of the apex impulse? Cardiac hypertrophy or dilata- 

tion, pressure of pleural el!uaion or of subdiaphragmatic tumors, contraction 
of a diseased lung with pleural and pericardial adhesions, situs inverstiB. 

4. At what a^ is pleural effusion most common? Under 40. 

5. Why does she prefer to lie upon the right side? Because that frees the left 

lung for breathing, the right being embarrassed by hydrothorax. 

6. What symptoms are likely to develop later in the course of this case? Pfun, 

oedema of the right arm and of the adjacent parts. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis : Evidence of pleural effusion coming on in an elderly woman whose 
breast has been removed for cancer suggests at once a cancerous metastasis 
at the root of the lung. A simple pleuritic effusion might develop at this 
Bge, but is rare. Hydrothorax is ruled out by the absence of notable cardiac 
weakness. Paracentesis will probably decide the diagnosis by revealing a 
heavy bloody fluid such as is common only in cancerous effusions. 

Prognosis: The outlook is hopeless and life cannot be prolonged many months. 

Treatment: Temporary relief can be given by tapping the chest whenever 
dyspnoea becomes urgent. Otherwise the treatment is wholly symptomatic."
"CASE 49 

A shoemaker of 24, who haa previously t>6Â«D well, h&a noted for aix 
months, gradually increasing weakness of the legs. He dates the trouble 
from a fall from a horse car six months before, when he struck violently 
upon his knees and fell several times more on his way home. Kept at 
work till three months ago, when he took a three weeks' vacation and 
improved considerably; but, on returning, found himself unable to 
work more than half a day. 

Two months ago the hands and arms began to get weak and numb, 
and now he can't button his collar. The hands feel rather better when 
he stirs about and uses them. For the past week has felt as if some- 
thing were tied tightly about his waist. In other respects he feels per- 
fectly well. He haa never used alcohol and denies venereal disease. 

Examination: Pupils equal and react normally. Soft systolic 
murmur at the apex, transmitted two inches to the left. Pulmonic 
second decidedly louder than aortic. No evidences of cardiac enlarge- 
ment. Chest and belly otherwise negative. Deep tenderness over 
calves, thighs, and buttocks. Knee-jerks absent, muscular power feeble, 
sensation perfect, moderate general atrophy. Faradie irritability of the 
muscles impaired in both arms and legs. Galvanic irritability normal. 
At times the tips of the fingers sweat profusely. 

When seen his temperature was 99.8Â°, pulse 120, respiration 24. 

1. What can be inferred trom the mode of onset here? The fall was not the cause 

but only the first manifestation of his trouble. 

2. What can be inferred from the atrophy? It mdicatee neuritie, not tabes. 

3. Causes and types of atrophy? Disuse, neuritis, progressive muscular atrophy, 

chronic joint disease, poliomyelitis anterior, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 

4. Causes of muscular tenderness? Neuritis, myositis (cf)., trichiniasis), (edema, 

or infiammation of neighbonng tissues. 

5. What other types of tenderness are there? Cutaneous hypertestheeia, serous 

membrane hyperssthesia (as in appendicitis and other abdominal lesions), 
bone tenderness, as in periostitis, nerve tenderness, as in neuritis. 

6. What do (a) the electrical reactions in this case teach? (b) the sweating fingers? 

(a) typical action of degeneration is absent, (t) vasomotor changes. 

7. ESagnoMS? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis : Muscular weakness and tenderness with absent knee-jerks, atrophy, 
and partial reaction of degeneration, all suggest neuritis. In tabes, there is 
DO tenderness and muscular power is good. In progressive muscular atrophy 
the knee-jerk is not lost so early and sensory symptoms are usually absent. 
The slight fever points towards neuritis, likewise the vasomotor symptoms. 
The cause of the neuritis cannot be guessed from the data before us. 

Prognosis: Recovery will probably be complete if the cause of the neuritis is 
removed, but it will be slow and will take many months. 

Treatment: Nourish the muscles and the skin by massage, hydrotherapy and 
electricity. The patient should do such work as he can painlessly. If any 
cause for the neuritis can be found (lead, arsenic), it should be removed." 
"CASE 50 

A married lady, childless, 55 years old, of good family history, is 
seen in February, 1900. She passed the menopause without difficulty, 
and several years ago had cystitis, with good recovery. During the 
winter of 1899 she travelled in North Africa, going to Germany toward 
spring. There her appetite became capricious and she suffered occa- 
sionally from slight nausea, without vomiting. She then had an attack 
of ""grippe,"" which much impaired her strength. In the early summer 
she returned home, when her appetite and digestion improved much 
and her strength returned in great measure, though her friends remarlced 
that she was distinctly paler than formerly. She considered herself 
well enough until five months ago, when she began to suffer from sciatica, 
at first and more severely in the right side, but later also in the left. 
About a month later her appetite failed again and more or less constant 
nausea came on, with occasional vomiting, the latter without relief or 
definite relation to either the time of taking food or its quality. Then 
came on very troublesome salivation, leading her constantly to spit up 
a clear, somewhat frothy fluid, which is sometimes poured out in such 
quantity as to run from her mouth. This persists to the present time. 
The sciatic pain now has practically disappeared. She has kept her 
bed for some weeks, losing flesh (though she is still stout), but sleeping 
well. Of late there has been slight bleeding from the gums, but no 
other hemorrhage has been noted. 

Pulse 96, regular, soft; temperature 99, above which point it is said 
not to have risen. Except for marked pallor, physical examination is 
negative. The urine is negative and contains no arsenic. Several 
examinations of the gastric contents show neither free HCl nor lactic 
acid. 

An examination of blood slides shows: Red cells 3,000,000 or there- 
abouts; white 15,000; Hg. relatively low. 

Reds: Rouleaux well formed, deformities slight, no polychroma- 
tophilia, average diameter normal, one normoblast. 

Whites: Polymorphonuclear 80%; lymphocjrtes 20%; eosino- 
philes 0%. 

1. What typee of aniemia are oftenest seen at 557 PemiciouH ansmia, aad that 
* secondaiy to cancer, metrorrhagia or other hemorrtiage. 

2. What dieeaaes are oftenest diagnosed (wrongly) as ""Grippe""? Tuberculoeis, 

febrile gastro-enteritia, tonaillitij9 and phaiyogitia, bronchitis, and many 
infections not yet named. 

3. Significance of the atnence of free HCl in tlie gastric contents? It may be 

temporarily absent in many conditions and often without any known cause. 
Permanent absence of HCl is commonest in diabetes, gastric catarrii and 
other chronic dyspepsias, gastric cancer, and pernicious aniemia.

4. What further infonnation about the stomach is needed here? Its wie and 
motor power. 

6. Diagnoms? PrognowHT Treatment? 

IKagDoais: The cause of the marked uuemia here present should be looked for 
ui one of the foUoinng diseases: Intestinal parasites, mTxiedenia, malignant 
disease, pernicious anieinia. Mjxoedenia is suggested only by the saUva- 
tion and can be ruled out by the therapeutic test. The stools should be 
searched for eggs of intestinal parasites. Careful pdvic and alxlominal ex- 
amination should be made under ether or in a warm bath in search for a 
foous for malignant disease. The blood is not typical of pernicious aniemia, 
but is consiatent with that disease in a period of remission. Diagnosis is 
impoesiUe from the data liere given. [Later in the case evidences of gastric 
cancer appeared.] 
Prognoeie: The outlook is almost hopeless, though early operation saves some 
cases. As a rule life is not prolonged tieyond two years, but after careful 
diet, with or without gastro-entÂ«roBtomy, a great improvement may occur 
for a few months. 
Treatment; Careful diet and lavage produce striking temporary improvement 
in some cases. The administration of HCl is apparently of value. In ail 
doubtful or eufy cases operation should be advised."
"CASE 51 

A bank president, 74 years old, of large frame, lost his father at 64 
from apoplexy, his mother at about the same age from phthisis. Sev- 
eral of his sisters also died of phthisis. His health has been exception- 
ally good, and a daughter cannot remember his having taken to his bed 
before. During the past year his weight has gradually fallen from 240 
to perhaps 190 lbs. His color has been poor occaeionally, and it has 
been noticed that a sudden pull on the part of his horses while driving 
would make him cry out, ""Oh! my stomach!"" He has not been able 
to walk as much as formerly on account of pain in the back and dysp- 
noea. He has also had sleepy turns, even after breakfast, for a year or 
more. About four weeks ago, walking up a slight incline after a con- 
cert, he lost his breath and had to stop six times on his way home, even 
after he reached level ground. December 25 he sent for his physician 
for a ""catarrhal cold,"" The pulse was 38, regular, the temperature 
subnormal; there was some cedema and eczema of the legs, and moist 
rales over the base of both lungs, without notable dulness or change in 
the quality of the ""respiratory murmur. He stayed indoors and three 
days later took to his bed. Very soon after this he had frothy, profuse 
and thin, pink expectoration, with somewhat labored but not quickened 
respiration. The slow pulse persisted. The urine was about a quart 
in twenty-four hours, normal in specific gravity, with hyaline and finely 
granular casts. 

January 13 he was seen in consultation. Hia chief complaint was 
of weakness and anorexia. Digestion fair, bowels regular; practically 
no cough or expectoration. Most of the time is passed in sleep. He 
lies by preference on the right side, with the head low. He looks less 
than his age; the lips are slightly cyanotic, the respiration easy, the 
tongue moist and clean, the mind clear when awake. The pulse is 38, 
regular, synchronous with the apex beat. During the last fortnight it 
has never been found above 40, and has been counted at 24, The 
radial arteries are slightly degenerated. The cardiac impulse is in the 
fifth space, nearly an inch beyond the left nipple; dulness seems rather 
increased to the right. Systolic murmurs are heard in both the aortic 
and mitral areas, and the second sound is reduplicated at the apex. 
The lungs are clear. There is dulness below the right costal border, 
but palpation gives negative results in that region. Beyond sUght 
oedema of the feet, physical examination is otherwise practically n^a- 
tive. 

1. Common cauaes of loss of weight? Improper or ineufficient diet, diarrbcea, 
arterio-scleroais and the attendant changes of old age, loss of sleep, malignaDt 
disease. 

2. Causes of bradycardiat It is important to distingui^ infrequent heart-beat 

from infrequent pulae-beat due to f^ure of transmission of a weakened car- 
diac impulse. True bradycardia occuib after fevers, great esertion, par- 
turition, in the toxtemia of nephritis, cirrhosia, and jaundice, in organic brain 
disease (tumor, absceas, meningitiB). The moat marked and long continued 
cases of biadf cardia are usually associated with coronary sclerosis and myo- 
carditis. 

3. How is the frothy, pink expectoration to be explained in view of the fact 

that at a later examination the lungs were clear? Frothy, pink expec- 
toration with labored respiration is in all probability due to pulmonary 
<Bdenva. This condition may be teropoiarily produced and arrested by 
unknown causes, and thus at a later examination may be wholly absent. 

4. What is to be suspected when epigastric pain seems to be brought on (as in 

this case) by exertion? Angina pectoris. 

5. What physical signs should be looked for in the neck in this caeef Systolic 

jugular pulsation. 

6. Diagnosis? Prognows? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: In a man of 74, with symptoms distinctly suggesting angina pectoris, 
the association of sleepy turns and a pulse between 24 and 38 means Stokee- 
Adams syndrome with coronary sclerosis. The dyqtncea, the ""catarrhal 
cold,"" the later attack of pulmonary cedema, the urinary and digestive symp- 
toms, and the slight ledema of the feet, are all to be explained as results of 
myocardial weakness. The loss of wei(^t is probably due to arterio-eclerods. 

Prognosis: Nothing is more difficult than to state the probable duration of 
life in such a case. Recovery is impossible and death may occur at any 
time, yet life may be prolonged and consideiable comfort secmsd for months 
or years. ^^ 

Treatment: Restriction of activity, mental and phyNcal, gOg^^giene, limita- 
tion of sodium chloride in the diet, and the administrat^p of KI and nitro- 
glycerine in small dosee, are the chief indications. .j"
"CASE 52 

A well-developed and fairly well-nourished man, 18 years old, is seen 
for tbe first time February 26. His father died ol oonaumption, his 
mother of rheumatism and heart disease. He has never drunk steadily, 
though occasionally to excess. He chews five cents' worth of tobacco 
and smokes twenty cigarettes daily. For eighteen months, ending 
seven months ago, he had almost daily coitus. For the last six months 
he has had gonorrhcea. When a child he had diphtheria, at fourteen 
typhoid, for the past seven months pain in the epigastrium, on rising, 
and latterly some pains about the head. Ten days ago, when he tried 
to get up, he had vertigo, chiUiness, sweating, and a feeling of un- 
steadiness. He has been in bed most of the time since. 

The symptoms were: weakness, backache, epigastric pain (without 
nausea or vomiting), cough with whitish expectoration, thirst, headache, 
and constipation. His chief complaint now is weakness, next to that 
headache and dizziness. There is some dyspncea, but the cough is not 
troublesome. There has been no nosebleed. 

The patient is pale. His pupils are equal and react to light. The 
tongue is protruded promptly and in a straight line, is not particularly 
tremulous and bears a slight white coat. Both sides of the chest move 
equally; there are no areas of marked dulness, of increased vocal reso- 
nance, or of bronchial breathing. A few coarse moist rales are heard 
persistently at the right apex. The heart's apex is in the fourth space 
in the nipple line. There is no murmur nor enlargement. The pec- 
toral muscle contracts when percussed. The skin flushes easily. The 
abdomen is enlarged, tympanitic, not tender. There is gurgling in the 
right iliac fossa. The spleen cannot be felt; its area is tympanitic. 
The hepatic area is normal. There are no rose spots. The knee-jerks 
are hvely. A few glands are felt in the left side of the neck, and on the 
right side is a scar. The white cells number 3600. Temperature 101Â°, 
pulse 80, respirations 25. The urine has a slight trace of albumen, with 
a sediment containing pus and squamous epithelium. No diazo reaction 
is present. No tubercle bacilli are found in the sputum. 

During the next five days the temperature is irregular, varpng 
between 99Â° and 103Â°. The respirations rise slightly, to 30. On 
March 1 a faint diazo reaction is obtained. The headache ceases after 
February 29, Constipation persists. On March 2 the physical exam- 
ination is the same as on February 26, On March 3 there are invol- 
untary micturition, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, and external strabismus 
Nothing peculiar is noticed about the neck. 

1. What are the most eignificant facts in tbia case? The family history of tuber- 
culoais, the debilitating habits, the existing gonorrhcea, the headache and 
vertigo, the penistent raiea at the right apeix, the fever, the leucopenia, the 
headache, Cheyne-Stokee breathing, and strabiatnus. 

2. What b the importance of the puknooary signs? In spite of the abeence of the 

tubercle bacilli in tbe sputum, such signs are distinctly suggestive of tuber- 
culous. Tbey may, however, result from broncho-pneumonia due to infiuraia 
or unknown infections. 

3. Why is tbe cardiac impulse displaced upward? Because of the abdominal dis- 

tention. 

4. What do you infer if a pectoral muscle contracts when percussed? Increased 

muscular irritability, such as is present in many cases of debility, however 
produced. 
6. Doee the course of the temperature curve suggeet any particular disease? Such 
a curve is most often seen in pyogenic infections. 

6. What is the value of the diaio reaction in this case? The presence of a diazo 

reaction is never of conuderable diagnostic value, thou^ its absence in a 
febrile case argues against typhoid. In any disease it is a bad prognostic sign. 

7. What is the value of the sputum examination in this case? A single negative 

sputum examination must be repeatedly confirmed t)efore it becomes evi- 
dence against pulmonaiy tuberculosis. 

8. What further examinations should be made in this case? None is essential, 

but a Widal test and a lumbar puncture would help to decide the question 
between typhoid and meningitis, and if the latter exists, to determine the 
organism to which it is due. 

9. How do you explain the condition of the neck? Only by saying that any single 

symptom of any disease may be absent in a particular case. 

10. rKagnosisT Prognosis? Treatment? 

DiagnoMs: The data collected in the answer to question (1) point strongly 
toward acute general tuberculosis with predominant menmgeal symptoms. 
Typhoid fever is the moat important alternative, but seems unlikely, in view 
(A tbe marked cerebral symptoms. A WidaJ reaction would help to settle 
this question, also a lumbar puncture. The leucopenia is C0QBistÂ«nt with 
tufcerculous meningitis, but not with other types. The famUy bbtory of tu- 
berculosis, the cervical adenitis, the scar and the signs at the ri^t pulmonaty 
apex, also support the diagnosis of general tuberculous infection. The tem- 
perature is consistent, likewise the diazo I'eaction. The condition of the 
abdomen is one often seen in a variety of infectious diseases. 

In the further coume of the case, the mental dulness deepened to stupor, the 
pulse gradually fell to 70, swallowing became difficult, ankle-clonus appeared, 
and the arms were at times rigid and contracted, lu view of all these facts, 
tbe diagnosis of general tuberculosis with menin^tis was made with con- 
fidence and was confirmed at autopsy. 

Prognosis and Treatment. (See above. Case 20.)"
"CASE 53 

Single Iftdy, 57 years old, always more or less of a nervoua invalid, 
consults a physician for palpitation and dyspncea on exertion. The 
menopause occurred five years ago, and since then she has been getting 
very stout and disinclined to exertion. She is thirsty and her skin is 
dry and perspires very little. Of late, the feet have been swelling and 
her face seems puffy all the time, not especially under the eyes. She 
is troubled a great deal with headaches, worse, at night, and her hair has 
been coming out of late. No sore throat, but the shin bones are tender 
and the tissues over them pit slightly on pressure. The bowels are very 
costive, appetite capricious, sleep disturbed by headache. Her mem- 
ory is very poor and she takes little interest in anything. 

Physical Examination: Heart's area cannot be marked out on ac- 
count of the great thickness of the fat layer. The apex is not seen 
or felt; best heard in sixth space, one inch outside nipple. Sounds 
heard feebly, action irregular. Pulmonic second sound accentuated; 
no murmur. Lungs and abdomen negative. Temperature 97.8Â°, 
pulse 100. Urine 1018, acid, large trace of albumen, ho sugar. Amount 
two quarts. Sediment: hyaline, granular casts, small diameter, some 
with cells adherent. Blood: Red 6,000,000; white 12,000. CEdema of 
ankles. Hands and feet cold. 

1. Cause of feeble heart sounds in this case? The thick fat I&yer. 

2. What are the common causes of teademess over the shins? (Edema, periostjtia. 

3. Why is the number of red cells bo large? This number is oftea found in periect 

health. Here it ia probably due to weak circulation and peripheral stasis. 

4. What causes of headache are common at 577 Arierio-BclepOBia, urtemia. 

fi. What further teats ate important for diagnosis? Measuteraent of the day and 
the night urine. The effects of thyroid extract. 

6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: (a) Obesity and its results, (6) arterio-eclerosb with involution 
psychosis, and (c) myxtedema, should be considered. Neither of the first two 
oftÂ«n produces dry skin or loss of hair. In favor of myxtedenia are the age 
and sex, the cutaneous, facial, and mental changes, and the sub-normal tem- 
perature.' The administration of thyroid extract was followed by a rapid and 
permanent amelioration of all the symptoms (including those referable to the 
heart and kidney), and the diagnosis of myxoedema was thus confirmed. 
Prognosis: In most cases the symptoms can be permanently checked by the 
continued use of thyroid extract; occasionally it is difficult rightly to gauge 
the dose, and a few patients do not at first bear the drug well. 
Treatment: The thyroid preparations furnished by any of the leading pharma- 
ceutical firms are usually satisfactory. Beginning with two grains twice 
a day, the dose should be gradually increased until fifteen grains a day are 
taken. If at any time the pulse rises more than ten beats above its normal 
level, the drug should be stopped until the rate becomes normal again. If 
this precaution is observed no serious symptoms of thyroidiam will occur. 
In the earlier stages of treatment, loss of weight is rapid and laudable." 
"CASE 54 

A sailor, 39 years old, is seen on November 5, Hia mother died ot 
""stomach trouble."" Has had gonorrhoea three times, and 10 years ago 
a sore on hia penis. No secondary symptoms were observed. Always 
well up to two years ago, when he began to have epigastric pain after 
eating. He vomited frequently and usually with relief of pain. After 
three months in a hospital, he improved somewhat, but after dis- 
charge the old symptoms returned and with them headache and 
alternate constipation and diarrhoea. He again entered a hospital and 
remained 6 months, but lost strength and weight steadily and vomited 
everything taken. The vomitus, occasionally amounting to a quart at 
a time, was often ""dark in color, and now and then contained a streak 
of blood."" The patient is much prostrated and emaciated. The 
abdomen is retracted, but more prominent in the epigastrium, where 
there is some rigidity of the muscles and a little tenderness. Physi- 
cal examination is otherwise negative. Pulse 110, respiration 18, 
temperature 98Â°, Urine 1020, alkaline, no albumen, no sugar. The 
inflated stomach extends from the normal limit above to an inch below 
the umbilicus. Its capacity is fifty-four ounces. Two days ago, an 
hour after a test breakfast of one ounce of bread and ten ounces of 
water, twenty ounces of brownish fluid, containing much mucus, were 
withdrawn. Free HCl and blood absent. Lactic acid, intense reac- 
tion. Butjoic present. This morning the stomach was washed out 
again, and a pint of oat-gruel was given. An hour and a quarter later 
twenty ounces were withdrawn which contained considerable mucus 
but no blood. Free HCl absent; combined, present in small quan- 
tity. Lactic acid, a trace. Total acidity, .237. The leucocytes 
before eating numbered 5600; after 7300. The stomach after infla- 
tion extended from the normal limits above to an inch below the 
umbilicus. Its capacity was fifty-seven ounces. 

1. How many ouncea of fluid does the aomutl stomach hold? About torty-eight- 

2. Significance of mucus in the stomach content? Mucus ia always present 

in the stomach. By practice with many cases needing gastric lavage, one 
leams to ncognize how much mucus is to be extracted from the normal 
stomach, and hence to recognize marked excess suggesting catarrh. 

3. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis : Gastric pain and vomiting {the vomitus bloody, and sometimes a quart 
inamount), loss of fiesb and strength, evidences of gastric dilatation and stasis, 
and the contbued absence ot HCl, all point towards pyloric cancer. The sear 
ot an ulcer near the pylorus (peptic or syphilitic) might, by contraction and 
obetruction ot the pylorus, bring about gaitric dilatation, staus, and the other 
symptoms ot this case; but the continued absence of HCl, the absence ot 
hemoptysis and the age, make gastric cancer more likely. 

Prognosis and Treatment. (See above. Case 50.)" 
"CASE 55 

A woman of 41, with good family history, has been married twice. 
The cause of the death of her first husband is unknown. During her 
first marriage she had two miscarriages. By her second husband, who 
appears healthy, she has never been pregnant. She has no rheumatic 
history. For 10 years she has not been able to walk far without dysp- 
no^, but her health was good until seven years ago, when at Carls- 
bad she took several baths, and just after the last a sudden left 
hemiplegia developed. For 4 months she could not be moved, and 
the left arm and leg, though useful, have never regained full power. 
She has always risen once in the night to urinate. Yesterday she was 
as well as usual. She wakened her husband about 1 a.m. to-day, and 
again, later, spoke to him. By 4 a,m. she was semi-conscious, could 
not speak, and had a right hemiparesis, most marked in the face. 

Next mormng the color and nutrition were good, the face not 
flushed, respiration easy, the breath free from odor. The tongue was 
slowly protruded on demand, but her comprehension was much limited. 
Temperature normal. The radial pulse could not be counted: the 
apex beat was sometimes 44, again 72 per minute. The first apex 
sound was excessively sharp, the pulmonic second accentuated. No 
murmurs, no thrill. The heart did not seem enlarged. Complete 
aphasia and inability to swallow. She moved the right arm somewhat, 
the right leg a very little. Contractures of the left fingers. The su- 
perficial reflexes were absent; no deep reflexes in the right arm or left 
leg; knee-jerk present on right. Abdomen negative. The urine was 
1012i in specific gravity, pale, with a slight trace of albumen, no sugar, 
a few hyaline and fine granular casts. 

1. Types of faciaJ paraljisis? Centr<d paralysis, usually appearing as part of hemi- 

plegia, aural paralyeig, occurring in catea of well-marked ear disease, and 
peripheral paraly^, occurring without any other leaioD. 

2. What odors in the breath are of diagnostic or prognostic value? Those of 

alcohol, acetone, and illuminating gas in diagnosb; the foul, heavy odor of 
many serious diseases in prognosis. 

3. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The sharp first sound, accented pulmonic second with chronic 
dyspncea and two attacks of hemiplegia point to mitral stenosis and cerebral 
embolism. The presystolic murmur has disappeared owing to cardiac weak- 
ness. Cerebral syphilis is suggested only by the history of miscarriage. 

Prognosis: She may live yeara, but the paralysis is not likely to be recovered 
from whoUy. 

Treatment: Feed by rectum until she can swallow, KI to exclude syphilis." 
"CASE 56 

A clerk, married, twenty-four, i9 seen Jan. 5. His family and 
previous history and habits are good. He went to bed the night of the 
3d in his usual health and slept well. On rising in the morning he had 
a severe chill, but went to business. After an hour or two he was 
obliged to return home, feeling very weak and aching all over. He 
took to his bed, raised some bloody sputum, had some nosebleed, and 
passed urine freely without pain, containing much fresh blood. 

When seen he did not look very ill; pulse 100, respiration 24, tem- 
perature 103.6Â°. He complained of no pain. Physical examination 
was negative, except for slight dulness with feeble respiration and fine 
rales over the left posterior base of the chest. 

There were several discrete, viscid, tawny sputa in a cup. The 
urine was smoky, 1014, with a very large trace of albumen, urea 1.64%. 

The sediment contained considerable normal and abnormal blood, 
rather numerous epithelial ca^ts of large diameter, one disintegrated 
blood cast; one or two large, fine granular casts. 

1. What diseases are apt to have such ao onset? Meningitis, infltienca, septictemia, 

tonsillitis, and pneumonia. 

2. What diagnoBtic data are wanting? The twenty-four hour amount of urine, 

microscopic examination of the sputum and of the blood. 

3. What conclusions can be drawn from the percentage of urea? No conclusions 

of any importance, unless the quantity and quahty of the patient's diet 
is known and controlled, unleaa we know the twenty-four hour amount of 
urine, and unless we can exclude such influences as vomiting and diarrhcea. 
Obviously, these conditions are not often possible. 
i. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The cUnical picture is that of an infectious fever with signs pointing 
especially to the left lung and to the kidneys. Tuberculosis and pneumonia 
are especially to be considered. As the hemoptysis preceded the nosebleed, 
it is not likely that all the blood came from the nose. The potation of the 
pulmonary signs and the suddenness of onset, with chill and general pains, 
are much more chaiucteristic of [meumonia than of tuberculosis. The absence 
of pain on the second day is unusual in pneumonia, but by no means unknown. 
The physical signs are not those of solidification, but are, nevertheless, just such 
as are often seen in the early stages of pneumonia. They are also consbtent, 
however, with tuberculoeis, and only by the course of the case and by repeated 
examinations of the sputum can tutiercuIostB be excluded. Jt leucocytosis 
were present it would favor the diagnosis of pneumonia as against tuberculous 
hemoptysis, but in tuberculosis pneumonia leucocytosis also occurs. 

Hematuria without pain and with so large a number of casta points to acute 
nephritis. Such an urine is decidedly characteristic of pueumococcus infec- 
tions and tends to support the diagnosis of pneumonia as against tuberculo^. 

Prognosis; About 75% of cases recover. The patient's good habits, previous 
history and present condition are in his favor, but the nephritis is unfavorable. 

Treatment : Diet according to digestive power. Open windows. Mild diuretics 
and the relief of symptoms aa they arise." 
"CASE 57 

An electrician, 31 years old, of good habits and family history, waii 
Been September 25. Except for an attack of ""inflammation of the 
bowels"" two years ago his previous health has been excellent. His 
work has been hard, and for about two months past he has been con- 
sciously tired. About ten days ago he had a little diarrhoea. He was 
then all right for several days. While walking in the street the evening 
of September 15, he was seized with severe cramps in the abdomen, not 
localized, Fecuning through the night and preventing sleep; no diarrhoea 
or vomiting. The next morning the doctor saw him in bed with noi^ 
mal pulse and temperature, no abdominal tenderness; the bowels had 
moved twice normally since the advent of the pain. The next day 
more or less general pain was still present; tenderness over the lower 
abdomen, more marked on the left side, was noted; the temperature 
was 102Â° A.M., 103Â° P.M.; there was some diarrhoea. Calomel was given 
the day before, opium both days. September 18 the morning tem- 
perature was 104.5Â°, pulse 110, pain and tenderness were more marked, 
and slight distention was noted. At the evening visit the pain had 
moved to the epigastrium and subsequently continued high rather than 
low. The following day the temperature dropped to 100, pulse to 90. 
The bowels did not move from the 18th until the 21st, then after enema. 
Again on the 24th there was a large, partly formed dejection, and 
much gas passed the 25th. Vomited twice on 21st after barley water; 
not before or since. Abdominal distention has gradually increased. 
The mind was clear; the pulse fairly good; tongue slightly coated; 
decubitus dorsal with legs outstretched; moderate pain and tenderness 
in upper abdomen, not sharply localized; chest negative; abdomen 
moderately and generally distended, duller in the flanks and hypogas- 
trium than superiorly, the dull areas changii^ somewhat with changing 
position. Urine and rectal examination negative. No tumor or local- 
ized resistance. Blood not examined. 

X. Common causes of symmetrical abdominal distention? Tympanites, obeÂ«ty, 

ascites, tuberculous peritonitis. 
2. What can be inferred from the statÂ«ment ''decubitus dorsal with 1^;b out- 
stretched""? That no considerable abdominal ptun is present. 
3- Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, with fever, rapid pulse, 
constipation, abdominal distÂ«ntion, slight general tenderness and shifting dul- 
ness in the flanks, points to general peritonitis probably due to appendicitis, 
possibly to cholecystitis. Calomel aggravated the lesions and opium masked 
the eymptons. Intestinal obstruction is excluded by the effect of cathartics. 
Prognosis: Perhaps one case in five recovers; the outlook depends upon the 

virulence of the infection and the skill and speed of the surgeon. 
Treatment: Laparotomy and drabage." 
"CASE 58 

A plumber of 40, of good family and previous history and good 
habits, had clap many years ago with good recovery. 

One year ago he had an obstinate cough with expectoration (not 
examined) and a ""patch"" in his right lower front chest. He went to 
Florida and recovered entirely. About two months ago he noticed 
swelling of the face and neck, especially in the morning, and had to 
enlai^ Ms collars. Stooping caused headache, a slight choking sensa- 
tion, and swelling of the veins of his face and neck. After some 
weeks he had fever, malaise, and swollen tender glands (?) in the neck, 
especially on the left side. In the course of a week he was so much 
better that he resumed work. Recently the swelling of the face and neck 
have returned and are more marked in the morning. The left arm 
ha^ also swollen, without pain or tenderness. He has had several nose- 
bleeds, with relief to his head. Yesterday his temperature was 101.4Â°, 
to-day 99.6"". Pulse 80, regular. The appetite, digestion, bowels, and 
sleep and respiration, are normal. The eyelids have been puffy, but 
are not so now. The face, neck, and upper part of the thorax are 
swollen and hypenemic. The veins of the arms and their valves are 
very distinct, especially on the left side, and are markedly dilated in 
the left lower axillary region and along the right diaphragmatic attach- 
ment. Visceral examination, the blood, and the urine are negative, 
also the throat. The voice is clear. No glands in either axilla or groin. 

1. What are the poaaible cauaea of swelling of one smi7 Venoua thrombosis or 

pressure on a venous trunk between the arm and the heart; inflamma- 
tory exudation (sepsis); arterial thrombosis. Occaaionally dropsical cedema 
may settle in one arm if the patient has been lying long 9n one side. 

2. What are the commtm causes of swelling of the face? Nephritis, cardiac disease, 

inflammatory oedema (as in erysipelas), angio-neurotic <edema. In the early 
morning many persons have swelling of the face off and on without known 
cause or sequehe. 

3. What can be inferted from the increase o! the swelling in the early momingT 

All types of facial oedema (whether of known or unknown origin) are apt to 
be more marked in the morning. Hence this change has no diagnostic value. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: (Edema and hyperemia of face, neck, upper thorax, and left ann, with 
dilated veins in these areas and lumps in the neck (later disappearing), point 
to mediastinal pressure on venous trunks. There are no signs of anemism. 
New growth is the only alternative. The thymus is a possible site of origin 
for the tumor. The other facts in the case are consistent with this diagnosis 
â which was confirmed at autopsy â cancer of the thymus. 

Prognosis; Progressive decline and death within six months. 

Treatment; X-ray should be tried, otherwise the treatment is symptomatic."
"CASE 59 

A business man, 58, with good family history and habita, had, about 
twenty-five years ago, a severe rheumatic fever, disabhng him for several 
months. Ever since then his pulse has been more or less irregular; but 
he has suffered no inconvenience until about two years ago when he 
noticed that walking up hill caused dyspncea. Since then he has lost 
upwards of fifty pounds in weight. For the past three months he has 
driven to his business for an hour a day only, and been kept awake by 
dyspncea and pain in the right side of the abdomen. Appetite has been 
poor and digestion impaired. 

Pulse irregular, intermittent, rapd, not corresponding with the 
heart-beat. Respiration easy when quiet, temperature 98.6Â°, 

Complexion sallow, with yellowish tinge to sclerotics. No cyanosis. 
Tongue heavily coated. Moderate cedema of lower legs. Lungs clear. 
Cardiac apex not defined to eye or touch. Percussion shows increase 
in the transverse <Uameter of the heart, the action of which is so rapid 
and irregular that only a doubtful systolic apex murmur can be 
heard. The second sounds are clear, the pulmonic not specially 



The belly is flabby, the navel not flushed. Pereuswon dulness in 
the flanks shifts with changing position. No fluctuation wave. Three 
inches below the right costal border and across the epigastrium a solid 
body, tender, with a firm edge descending with inspiration, is felt. 

The urine, normal in amount, specific gravity 1028, contains a 
large trace of albumen, 2% of sugar, 1.26% urea, no bile, acetone, 
or diacetic acid. Sediment, a few normal blood globules, a rare 
hyaline cast. 

1. Common causea of sugar in the urine? Diabetes mellitus, neuroses (wony, 

fear, etc.), coma from any cause (including narcotics), pregnancy. 

2. How do you explain tlie loss of weight? Poor appetite and digestion combined 

with arterio-ederosia and with glycoeuria. 

3. Commonest causes of pain in that r^on? Appendidtis, gall-stones, pelvic 

inflammation <in women). 

4. What caused the pain in the right side of the abdomen? Hepatic congestion. 

5. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Dyspncea, digestive disturbance, a dilated, rapid, and irregular 
heart, swollen legs, ascites, enlarged liver with slight jaundice and a urine 
showing renal congestion,^ all point to an uncompensated cardiac lesion with 
passive congestion of the lungs, stomach, liver, peritoneal cavity, kidney, 
and legs. The exact condition of the heart cannot be stated. Its insufficient 
strength may be due to mitral regurgitation produced by the old rheumatic 
endocarditis (see history) and compensated until two years ago. It is mora 
likely to be a myocardial weakness (with or without mitral disease) that pro- 
duces the poor heart action. He is at the age for arterio-sclerosis and so for 
mjrocardial weakneos, but we have no data here as to hig arteries. The 

glycosuria will probably persist. If so it ia to be classed as diabetes. 
Prognosis: Impossible to state accurately. Probably he will not live over six 

months, but he may live years, or die suddenly in a few days. 
Treatment: Rest, depletion, restriction of salt in diet; later, digitalis (cautiously) 

and Naubeim treatment, also with great caution. Genenl hygiene, diet, 

sleep, air, eQcourogement are of great importance." 
"CASE 60 

P. J, G., 20 years old, a piano varnisher, was admitted to the 
hospital Oct. 3, 1903. For about a year he had suffered from occa- 
sional paio in the epigastrium, and for six months had always had 
pain after taking food. One week ago, he received a blow in the 
right hypochondrium while boxing, and after that had slight pain in 
that region until the day before entrance, when he was taken suddenly 
ill with violent, griping pain, starting in the epigastrium and spreading 
all over the abdomen. His bowels had not moved since this pain 
started. He vomited after taking warm drinks, and had a chill lasting 
one hour. He walked to the Out-Fatient Department, where his tem- 
perature was found to be 100.3Â°, pulse 60. His skin was slightly 
yellow. The abdomen showed no distention. There was slight gen- 
eral spasm and tenderness over the gall-bladder region. No mass 
could be felt. The leucocyte count was 16,000. With rest in bed 
and emptying of the bowels by enemata, the tenderness and spasm 
over the gall-bladder region disappeared until on October 7 there 
were very few symptoms left. 

DisgnoeisT PrognoeisT Treatment? 

Diagnoeia: The symptomB are those of BcutÂ« localised peritonitb. Other 
causee of epigastric pain (auch as plumbism, tabes, and unemia) are excluded 
I^ the tenderness and spasm. LocaUsed peritonitis in a man of 20 is often- 
est caused by appendicitis, cbolecystitis, and gastric ulcer. Pancreatitis, 
intestinal obstruction, and BoBiting kidney are rare causes, especial^ in a 
young man. Acute gastro-enteritis usually produces diarrhoea and has less 
tenderness and spasm. 

Between appendicitis, cholocystitia, and gastric ulcer the following considera- 
tions should be weighed. Cholecystitis is not common under 25, never- 
thelesB the site of the physicBl signs in this ca^ corresponds accurately 
with that of the gall-bladder. Gastric ulcer is commoner in women. It is, 
however, faintly suggested by the history of gastric troubles heie. Appendi- 
citis usuaJiy produces signs lower down in the abdomen. The constitutional 
symptoms of the case are consistent with any of the three diagnoses con- 
sidered. 

An operation for gall-stones was done, but the gall-bladder and appendix were 
found normal. There was an excess of clear, dark, peritoneal fluid and a 
perforation of the stomach near the pyloric end, which was glued to the 
under surface of the left lobe of the liver by fresh adhesions. 

Prognosis; Untreated this lesion may result in pyloric obstruction and gastric 
dilatation, or it may produce no symptoma. Surgical interference may give 
prompt and perhaps permanent reUef ; â few cases have been followed up. 

Treatment : In this case posterior gastro-enterostomy was done and the patient 
was well and at work six months later. Probably surgical interference is 
the best treatment. At any rate there is no other. We do not yet know 
enough to say what proportion of cases remain well if untreated, and what 
proportion of surgical operetions are permanently successful in such cases." 
"CASE 61 

February 16 a lady of 30, married S years, is seen in consultation. 
She has had four children, the youngest four months old. After her 
second confinement had puerperal septicemia. The catheter was used 
and cystitis apparently followed, as the bladder was irrigated. Vesical 
symptoms were troublesome after this, and five separate times she 
underwent prolonged treatment under an eminent gynsecologist. Finally, 
discouraged by the persistence of her symptoms, she resorted to "" mind 
cÂ«re,"" with marked relief. Her last confinement was easy, but was fol- 
lowed by a return of vesical symptoms. For the last six weeks she has 
suffered from indigestion and has had frequent watery stools, preceded 
by abdominal pain. January 23 she came to Boston, and, acting on the 
advice of her ""mind cure"" friend, shopped, went to the theatre, and 
was generally very active. During this treatment she ate scarcely any- 
thing, and at the end of five days returned home. The next day 
vomiting appeared, and by February 1 the stomach retained nothing. 
The vomiting ceased within two days and has not since recurred. The â¢ 
bowels have continued loose, moving two to five times daily without 
notable pain. For two weeks there has been some cough, with little or 
no expectoration. Since February 1st, pyrexia has been constant, â 
as a rule, higher at night, though sometimes higher in the morning, 
ranging between 101Â° and 104Â°. The pulse has ranged between 110 
and 140. No delirium. 

The hands are clammy, the color of the face good, the eye bright, 
the mind clear, the knee-jerks lively. The chest and abdomen are nega- 
tive, except for medium rales at both bases, and there is some tender- 
ness along the colon. The urine is said to be negative. It is stated that 
she is a very reticent person and has never been known to be hysterical. 

DiagnoHia? Prognosis 7 Treatment? 

DiognoeLs: The patient has been well for four years. Hoioe there is no teason 
for connecting the puerperal sepsia or cystitis with the present symptoms. 
She suffers now from continued fever, which has lasted certainly sixteen days 
and probably more, diarrhcea with slif^t ^neral abdominal tenderness and 
dry cough (with rales at both bases). The condition of the blood is unknown. 
In this country there are three common causea of long-continued fever: gen- 
eral sepsis (including septic endocarditis), tuberculosis, and typhoid; less 
conunon are syphilis and gestivo-autumnal malaria. The month and the 
place make malaria unlikely. (Blood examination ruled it out.) Syphilis 
should show some lesions, with or without a history of its origin. Such lesions 
and history were absent here. There were no local signs of tuberculosis or of 
a septic focus, but as either of these diseases may exist without local signs 
the most important evidence in this case should be sought ,in the blood. 
This showed a Wtdal reaction and no leucocytosis. The subsequent course 
was that of typhoid, without the classical mental duloess. 

Prognosis and Treatment. (See above, Case 28.)" 
"CASE 62 

A cigarmaker, 51 years of age, is seen March 15. Famiiy history 
negative. Thirty-five years ago had tubercuioeis of the knee, which 
recovered after operation, but left a stiff joint. Eighteen years ago 
he had jaundice and fifteen years ago syphiHs, otherwise always well. 
Has used beer to excess. 

About six weeks ago, while in his usual health, he had an attack of 
acute broaehitia for which he was given iodide of potassium. This he 
says upset his stomach and caused vomiting which lasted for a number 
of days. About two weeks after his cough began he noticed that hie 
skin had a yellow tint which has been steadily deepening. Coinci- 
dent with the jaundice a circumscribed reddish eruption appeared 
on various parts of his body and limbs, which was diagnosed by his 
attending physician as erythema multiforme. Itching has been general 
and intense. There has been no vomiting for over two weeks, but his 
food has been carefully regulated. His appetite is poor. He has lost 
much in strength and flesh. His temperature has remained near the 
normal line, but has occasionally risen to 100Â° F., particulariy durir^ 
the last week. The pulse has varied between 70 and 80, with a rising 
tendency. The stools are elay-colored. 

Patient still preserves considerable fat tissue, but has evidently lost 
weight and looks sick. Deep icterus of a decidedly greenish tinge. 
Heart and lungs normal. The liver dulness begins at the sixth rib. 
Its lower edge, which appears to be smooth, can be felt about an inch 
below the costal margin- A fluctuating tumor of indefinite outline 
and size is suspected below the hepatic edge about in the mamillary line. 
Percussion over it shows an area of dulness about two inches in diameter. 
Deep palpation of abdomen reveals no other abnormality. No glandu- 
lar enlargement, no characteristic scars. Urine contains much bile, 
but no other abnormal constituents. White cells 8000. 

1. What points is the past history are most important here? The syphilis and 

the alcoholism. 

2. What diseases produce the deepest icterusT Gall-stones and cancer of the 

pancreas. 

3. (a) What is the tumor? and (b) what is its connection (if any) with the erup- 

tion and the itching? (a) Probably the gall-bladder. (6) None. The eruption 
is due either to KI or to syphilis (see below), and the itching to jaundice. 

4. Do you expect pain in this case? Why, or why not? Probably not, because 

there is probably no disease preeent which stretches the liver's capsule. 

5. What explains the fever? Syphilis and cancer both cause fever (see below). 

6. Are any important data missing? The condition of the cliest, the size of the 

spleen, evidence for or against ascites. 

7. IKagnosisT Prognosis? Treatment?

Diagnoms: Syphilis of the liver, cirrtiosta, gall-etonefl, and cancer are to be con- 
aidered. CHniioua cannot be diagnosed in tbe absence (as here) of anjr evi- 
dence of portal stasis. It cannot be poaitively excluded, but doee not account 
for all the facts in the case. Gall-stones are nuÂ«ly associated with both jaun- 
dice and palpable pll-bladder. (The tumor in the gall-bladder region is prob- 
ably thus to be expl^ned.) Syphilis can only be excluded t^ the therapeutic 
test, but it larely produces jaundice or enlarged gall-bladder. Cancer of 
tbe pancreas is the commonest cause of the group of symptoms here present; 
the common bile^uct is pressed upon by the tumor, and intense jaundice 
with dilated gall-bladder results. 

Prognosis: A few months of life. 

Treatment: Symptomatic"
"CASE 63 

A physician, 51 yeais old, is seen Jan. 15. Has had rheumatbm off 
and on since childhood, but no cardiac symptoms; has walked a great 
deal and has done a large practice without a carriage. November 17, 
he began to have chills and sweating at irregplar intervals, but kept at 
work until December 27, when he had sudden pain in the left leg, fol- 
lowed by some coldness and numbness. 

Since December 30, there has been fever from 99.5Â° to 103Â°, with 
irregular chills. Few days ago, seized with pain in right arm, and the 
pulse was not to be felt in that wrist. Also a transitory blindness in 
right eye. Pulse 72, r^ular, good strength. Presystolic murmur at 
apex. No cardiac enlargement. Arms and 1^ now warm. The 
patient is bright and not feeling very sick. Spleen slightly enlarged, 
palpable, tender. Some doubtful rose spots. At the right base be- 
hind a patch of bronchial breathing about the size of an apple with 
crackling rales and increased voice sounds. No distinct dulness. Urine 
said to be negative. 

1. Common causes of true chillsT Malaria, sepeie, tuberculoeu, the onset of any 

infection, neurasthenia. 
% In what diaeaaea beside malaria may cbilla recur daily at the same hour? 

SepÂ«Â«, tuberculoBia. 

3. Types of thrombosis? Puerperal, infectious (typhoid), post-operative, maran- 

tic, those seen in cardiac disease, and those of unknown cause. 

4. Causes of presystolic murmurs? Mitral stenosis, ""Flint's murmur"" in aortic 

regurgitation, tricuspid HtenosiB, adhesive pericarditis, 

5. What symptoms not here mentioned should you expect to see sooner or later 

in this case? Purpura, emaciation, diarrhcea, and mental symptoms. 

6. What should you tell the patient about his condition? Nothing unless he 

forced the issue. Then the prognosis as given below. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognons? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: A long-continued fever with chills, embolic phenomena, and a car- 
diac murmur suggest at once an infective endocarditis, whether "" malignant "" 
or not remains to be seen (see prognosis in Case 40). Emlioli appear to have 
lodged in the arteries of the left leg, ri^t arm, right eye, spleen, and lung 
(bronchopneumonia). The ""rose spots"" aie skin-embolL In view of the 
"" rheumatic "" history we may suppose that the acute endocarditis was here 
engrafted on a chronic process. Blood examination showed a marked leu- 
cocytosis and no Widal reaction. The urine showed the ordinary evidences 
of an infectious process. 

PrognoNS: Recoveiy is quite possible (see above. Case 40) but not likely. The 
symptoms may continue for weeks or months and finaUy cease or kill. Be- 
tween mild and malignant processes there are intermediate types of all degrees 
of severity. 

Treatment. (See above, Case 40.)" 
"CASE 64 

A Degress of 67 has had ""falling of the womb"" for forty years. 
To hold it up she stuffs a wad of cotton into the vagina and ties a tight 
bandage round the lower part of the abdomen. Some years ago a 
lump grew in her belly, â ""sore as a boil."" One night she heard a click, 
felt something give way, and ""it all ran out the front passage,"" after 
which she felt all right. Eight months' ago she noticed another lump 
in her belly, not tender, but sometimes ""it kicks just like a baby."" 

Five days ago she ""felt pretty smart,"" but had had no dejection 
for two days. Four days ago swelling of the belly, tenderness in the 
left groin and vomiting began. Three days ago had a small, hard 
dejection and ceased vomiting, but since then "" the lump in her belly 
haa been moving round and making a noiee."" Pain, distention, and 
constipation have continued. 

Examination: Does not seem much sick. Temperature 100Â°, pulse 
100, respiration 32. Chest negative. Belly much distended, tym- 
panitic, and somewhat tender, especially in the left iliac fossa, where 
there is dulness and a rounded mass size of an orange can be felt. Pres- 
sure over this mass causes the cervi uteri to move down. No thorough 
pelvic examination is possible on account of tenderness. 

1. What was the probable cause of the symptoms described in lines 5-7? Sal- 

pingitis or pelvic peritonitis. 

2. By what means can we secure abdominal relaxation when deep palpation is 

important? A warm bath or an anfesthetic if the bath ie ineufBcient. 

3. What light mi^t be thrown on this case by examination of the blood? If leuco- 

cytoais is absent, suppuration is unlikely. 

4. Should you recommend operation in thLs case? What would influence your 

decision? (See below â Treatment,) 

IHagnosisT Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis : The history is of salpingitis some years ago, â of a painless lump in 
the belly for eight months, and of five days' acute symptoms. The acute 
symptoms aie constipation, vomiting, painful, swollen, and tender belly, with 
borborygmi and slight fever. A mass apparently connected with the uterus is 
also felt. In a negress any pelvic disturbance should suggest fibroid, especially 
if there is a palpable tumor connected with the uterus. How can a fibroid 
produce acute syn^toms? By suppuration, twisting of a pedunculated por^ 
tion, or both. The methods of holding up the uterus described in paragraph 
one would certainly favor the occurrence of pelvic suppuration, but it is 
hard to say whether they are connected with the s3miptoms in this case. 
Further diagnosis is impossible with the data given. 

Prognosis and Treatment: It there is slight or no leucocytosis the trouble will 
probably quiet down under rest, enemata, hot poulticing, and, if the pain is 
severe, morphia. Try this for twenty-four hours and, it there is any ameliora- 
tion, tor twenty-four hours more. If at any time fever, pulse, or leucocytosis 
rise, or if pain and tenderness increase, operation may be needed. As a matter 
of tact this patient's symptoms were gone in ten days without operation." 
"CASE 65 

A laborer of 29 was seen March 5. Took to bed a week ago with 
fever. Now he looks very dull, with Upe dusky, tongue dry, and 
brown, teeth crusted with aordes. Temp. lOl.ff*, pulse 100, resp. 32. 
His chief complaint is of nervousness and insomnia, but he admits 
that his appetite is very poor and that he has vomited several times 
within the past week. He denies alcohol and venereal disease. 

Chest negative. Abdomen slightly distended, tympanitic, not ten- 
der. S[deen not felt. The skin is unusually smooth and silky. There 
is twitching of the arms and legs and tenderness of the latter. All his 
movements are very alert. Urine: Normal color, acid, 1020, a trace of 
albumen, no sugar, no diazo reaction. Sediment, much pus (microscopic) 
and mucus, a little normal blood. The Widal reaction is negative. 

Scattered over the whole body is a dull red macular rash, about the 
size of a split pea or smaller. In places it is copper-colored. 

1. What explains the condition of the mouth? Fever, mouth breathing, and neglect. 

2. (a) What are the commonest causes of msomnia in a laborer of 29? (b) Id old 

ageT (c) In a baby? (a) Alcoholiaro. (b) Arterio-BclerOBis and its consequences; 
phfÂ»ologically, the old sleep much less than the young, (c) Indigestion. 

3. IMognows? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The most distinctive physical signs here present are fever and a 
rath. The fever is moderate and is said to have lasted a week, but we cannot 
judge whether it was of the continued type, or uregular and intermittent. 
Nervousness, abnormally alert motions, and insomnia is a trio of signs which 
in a laborer we learn to associatfi with alcoholism and threatened delirium 
tremens. The smooth and silky skin is another important though not con- 
stant sign of alcoholism. The denial of drinking habits is not important in 
the presence of four such evidences. Can alcohol alone cause fever? Surely 
â and the fever is usually moderate, as in this case; but it is important to 
exclude by careful physical examination all infectious processes, especially 
pneumtmia. This has apparently been done in this case and the diagnosis 
would seem to be delirium tremens. The poor appetite and vomiting in the 
previous week are then probably of alcoholic origin. 

The rash is still unexplained. Macules of this size and color, without itching or 
hemorrhage, are usually due to syphilis. The patient's denial ot infection 
is not of importance and in this case was latÂ«r shown to be false. That the 
fever was in part of syphilitic origin was suggested by the fact that when 
the other symptoms of alcoholism ceased, the fever lasted on for some days. 
What other manifestations of syphilis might occur at this time? Adenitis, 
mucous patches, alopecia, periostitis, iritis. None of these appeared, however. 

Prognosis: Recovery from the alcoholism occurs in nine tenths of such cases 
within two weeks. Relapses are frequent. The syphilis has the usual 
certain prognosis of that disease. All that we can say b that if treatment 
is energetic and persistently carried out most cases get well. 

Treatment: For the alcoholism, careful feeding, hypnotics, a small amount 
alcohol, and such restraint as is necessary. For the ^philis, KI and Hg. 
applied in the usual ways and persistÂ«d in tor two years at least." 
"CASE 66 

A prominent manufacturer, 62, of good habits and family history. 
Never previously sick. Has been much confined for a year and weight 
has increased from 164 to 174 lbs. Was seen February 15. 

Shortly before Christmas he noticed shortness of breath on walking. 
His urine at that time was pronounced negative. The dyspnoea on 
exertion got no better and substernal pain extending over the arms was 
soon superadded. This pain was not veiy severe, and came on only 
during exertion. About two weeks ago, after a hearty, rapid, and 
rather indigestible mid-day dinner, he was taken at his mill, without 
antecedent exertion, with a very severe attack of pain as above de- 
scribed. When his physician reached him he was in a cold sweat and 
seemed alarmingly ill. Pulse 80, regular. After two hours he was 
driven home four miles, arriving with pulse at 80 and temperature at 
97.5Â°, The next day the pulse was 100, temperature 100Â°, rising to 120 
and 102Â° the next day. There was bloody expectoration, with signs 
of consolidation at the right posterior base. For the past week the pulse 
and temperature have been normal. When seen February 15 he stated 
that he felt perfectly well. He looked rather pale, lay in bed with his 
head low, breathing easily, not cyanotic. The pulse 80, intermitted 
occasionally. The artery was soft, tension not high. No cedema. The 
heart was not enlarged; sounds clear. A few rales without dulness 
over the left posterior base. Percussion was dull with resistance an 
inch below the right costal border, but the liver edge could not be felt. 
The urine, 52 to 54 oz. per diem, contained a decided trace of albumen 
and a few hyaline casts, sp. gr. 1020, urea 2%. 

1. What diseases increase weight? Obesity, cardiac and renal disease, myxoedema. 

2. Causes of bloody expectoration? PhthisiB, pneumonia, infarction of the lung 

due to congestion (as in mitral disease or from embolism), pulmonary abscess 
or gangrene, wounds or malignant disease of the lung, ruptured esophageal 
varices (in cirrhotic liver), leaking aneurism, 

3. IMagnosis? Prognoais? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: In a man of 62 dyspncea and substernal pain produced by exertion, 
extending to the arms and relieved by stopping, are-symptoms almost patho^ 
nomic of coronary sclerosis with angina pectoris. The pain of aneurism is 
somewhat similar, but has not the close dependence on exertion. The severe 
attack two weeks ago seems to have ended in pulmonary congestion and 
hypostatic pneumonia. The examination of February 15 adds only the 
evidence of an arterio-sclerotic kidney. It is surprising that arterial tension 
appears low. Was the aortic second accentuated? 

Prognosis: With great care such cases may live many yeara, but any exertion 
or excitement may prove fatal and the advance of the arterio-sclerosis lesions 
in heart, brain, or kidney may kill at any time. 

Treatment: Avoid mental and physical strain. Use nitroglycerine in attacks 
and KI stÂ«adily." 
"CASE 67 

A gentlenmD of 82 is seen April 17. He has always enjoyed good 
health, except that a number of years ago he suffered from attacks of 
pain in the right upper abdomen, diagnosed as bilious colic, and for 
which he kept morphine constantly on hand. During the past year 
he has aged rapidly, but he attended to business regularly until a 
month ago, when painless jaundice came on and rapidly deepened, the 
stools being clay-colored. A week ago the jaundice seemed less and 
some color was seen in the dejections, but this was only temporary. 
The appetite and digestion have been fair; he smokes a good deal. He 
has been up until to-day, when increasing weakness induced him to re- 
main in bed. Pruritus has interfered much with sleep. The tempera- 
ture has been normal until to-day, when 100Â° was registered. The pulse 
has been regular, about 70; yesterday it was irregular and intermittent. 

When seen he was sleeping in the right dorsal decubitus, with easy 
respiration; pulse 68, regular, of fair strength and volume. Icterus in- 
tense, the tongue heavily coated, the mind clear. 

Thoracic examination gave negative results, except for slight crepitus 
at the right posterior base. A smooth edge could be felt below the 
right costal border, descending with inspiration, not tender. The gall- 
bladder could not be felt. Abdomen soft, otherwise negative. Urine 
sufficient in amount, 1018 in specific gravity, deeply icteric, with a 
trace of albumen, hyaline and granular casts. 

1. Name and disttnguish five common varieties of colic? Biliary, renal, uterine, 

iDteatinal (including saturnine) and that due to Dietl's crises. In biliaiy 
colic the pain is apt to spread from the region of the gall-bladder to the back 
and right scapular region; jaundice may appear before, during, or after tbe 
attack. In renal colic the pain follows some portion of the course of the 
ureter, and is often associated with the passage of blood or gravel by urethra. 
UtÂ«rine colic is usually associated with or precedes flowing â menstrual or 
irregular â and is referred to tbe groins or pelvis. Intestinal colic (if not 
saturnine) is associated with diarrhcea or flatulence. It shifts its position 
frequently. Lead colic is recognized only by association with other evi- 
dence of lead (gums, blood, brain, extensor muscles). Dietl's crises are 
recognized only by the association of abdominal pain with the presence of 
a floating kidney and the absence of the signs of other colics. 

2. What significance has the fact that the gall-bladder is not felt here? A gall- 

bladder not tense with fluid cannot be felt, whatever its size, and the belly 
walls often prevent any satisfactory exploration of this region. Hence nega- 
tive evidence is of little value. 

3. What cerebral symptoms are likely to appear later in this case? Coma, delirium, 

vomiting, and convulsions â as in ursmia. 

4. When a patient ages rapidly what disease is probable? Arterio-scleros'is. 
Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? (See above, Cases 23 and 62.) 
Autopsy showed cancer of the duodenal papilla." 
"CASE 68 

A young married woman of 21 had an abortion done at the third 
month. Immediately following this she began to vomit occasionally, 
and after two days could retain nothing. The lochia were sweet, tem- 
perature normal, and there was no tenderness in the pelvis. Rectal 
alimentation was tried for three days and the vomiting ceased, but 
recommenced as soon as liquids were given by mouth. Again rectal 
feeding was tried, but this time the vomiting did not cease. The nutrient 
enemata are fairly well borne, the nurse says, but the patient is very 
sleepless and thirsty and has four or five severe retching spells in every 
twenty-four hours. She is seen in consultation on the sixth day of 
rectal feeding. 

The temperature and pulse are normal, as they have been through- 
out; the voice clear and the patient moves strongly in bed. Examina- 
tion of the chest, belly, and pelvis are entirely negative. 

1. How can we determine d^iig rectal feeding whether the enemata are being 

well borne and absorbed? In ideal cases, there is no thirst or insomnia, 
hunger is appeased by the enema, nothing comee away except with the daily 
cleaning enema, and little weight is lost. 

2. What means should be used to control the letching in this case? (See below â 

Treatment.) 

3. What important parts of physical examination have been omitted? Urinatyais 

and blood examination. 

4. Significance of the normal pulse and temperatura here? Prostration is not 

great; infection probably absent. 
6. Diagnosb? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Pelvic aepsis is excluded by the normal lochia, the absence of fever, 
pain or pelvic tenderness. Retroversion of the uterus is said to produce 
vomiting in some cases of this type, but the pelvic examination excludes this. 
Can the vomiting t>e ursEmic? To determine this, we examined the urine 
and found it normal. (The blood was also normal.) The rectal feeding was 
evidently a failure despite the nurse's assurance, and the patient's nervous 
system was kept irritable by semi-starvation. Could this account for the 
vomiting? In view of the negative results of physical examination it seems 
the most probable diagnosis. Had the enemata been well absorbed the ner- 
vous system would probably have been sufBciently nourished to control the 
vomiting centre. As if is, she is getting no food and losing much sleep. Natu- 
rally the vomit mg continues. 

Prognosis: If this diagnosis is correct, the resumption of feeding by mouth and 
the abandonment of rectal feeding will probably check the vomiting in a tew 

Treatment: The ordinaty remedies for vomiting â ice, cocaine, cerum oxalate, 
hydrocyanic acid, morphia, and rectal feeding â had already proved failures. 
Under a resumption of feeding by mouth, together with the discontinuance 
of the source of insomnia and irritation (the enemata), and with effectual 
encouragement, the vomiting ceased within a few days and the patient's 
recovery was uneventful. The diagnosis was thus verified."
"CASE 69 

Man, 66 years old, has had for fifteen months pain; for the first 
month it was referred to the right hip and buttock. Later, it was felt 
in the amali of the back and in both scapular regions; for six months, 
pain has been felt in the other hip and occasionally in both legs. 

For a month he has had considerable cough, with sputum, occasion- 
ally blood-streaked. He has always been finicky about his food, but 
complained of no special digestive disturbance, except loss of appetite 
and constipation, which have been continuous and accompanied by 
loss of flesh. He was previously very fat. For several weeks he has 
been in bed. Of late has had several attacks of retention of urine, 
needing catherization. 

Examination: Spare, but by no means emaciated; arcus senilis 
marked. Heart negative, so also the lungs except for scattered 
patches of rales in both backs and in the right axilla. Abdomen 
negative. Knee-jerks normal; no tenderness or loss of sensation. 
Spine straight and not tender. 

Urine 1016, alkaline, trace of albumen, considerable pus and squa- 
mous cells. Blood: Red cells 3,810,000; white cells 17,000; hamoglobin 
55%, In the stained specimen polynuclear leucocytes were abnormally 
increased and three normoblasts were seen during a differential count 
of 500 leucocytes. Temperature 99, pulse 90, respiration 22. 

1. What is the Ngnificance of the temperature in this caae? 1Â£ it continues at or 

below that point, infections {e.g., phthiBia or sepsis) are very unlikely. 

2. What all-important diagnostic data are here lacking? Pupillaiy reactions, 

sputum examination, the twenty-four hour amount of urine. 

3. If the knee-jerks had been absent, what other disease should be considered? 

Tabes doisalis. 

4. How are the lung signs to be interpreted? Localized bronchitis or oedema. 

6. What further knowledge do we wish regarding the spine? Is it everywhere 
normally fiexible? 

6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis; The spine was found to be stiff in the lumbar region and epondyhtis 
was considered. But the loss of appetite, the anemia, and the leucocjitoeia 
pointed to something leas purely local in its effects. Sputum examination, 
four times repeated, was negative and practically excluded phthisis. Ab- 
dominal aneurism would account for some of the pains, but should produce 
a palpable tumor. The pains are such as would be produced by pressure 
on the spinal nerve roots. Malignant disease of the prevertebral glands 
would explain the pains, the ontemia, and the loss of appetite. Autopey con- 
finned this diagnosis and showed in addition numerous metastases in each 
lung â accounting for the pulmonary signs and symptoms. Hypertrophied 
prostate with slight cystitis explained the bladder symptoms. 
Prognosis; Death in the couree of a year. 

Treatment: Purely symptomatic. A plaster jacket might relieve some of the 
pain by immobilizing the spine." 
"CASE 70 

A girl of 19 is seen May 26. Her maternal grandfather died of 
phthisis. Family history otherwise good. She has always been rather 
pale and delicate, but had no definite or serious illness. Toward the 
end of February she consulted her physician for slight swelling of the 
glands on the left side of the neck. The temperature was slightly 
elevated when taken after this, and during the next two weeks the 
glands increased considerably in size and she had some cough, appar- 
ently due to bronchitis. Toward the end of March she began to im- 
prove and the glandular swelling to subside. The appetite increased 
and she got out. Two weeks ago she was less well; fever returned to a 
moderate degree, as did cough, and slight crepitus was heard under 
both clavicles. One week ago, the day being mild, she sat on the door- 
step and experienced a sudden pain at the root of the nose, just between 
the eyes. This pain extended over the forehead, increased in intensity 
and was relieved more by cold than by hot applications. Four days 
ago without obvious cause she vomited once. The next day she vom- 
ited again and the headache became intense. For the past forty-eight 
hours she has retained nothing on her stomach. To-day, there was 
slight hiccough after vomiting and the menses appeared, the first time 
for three months. Morphia by the mouth gave her no relief. In the 
last twelve hours she has had three suppositories containing a quarter 
of a grain of morphia each, with only partial relief to her headache. 
Before the morphia was begun the pupils were large, equal, and reacted 
equally to light. Her aunt states that the pupils have alwa^ been 
large. They are now moderately contracted, equal, and respond nor- 
mally. Photophobia. The pulse has ranged 90 to 100. Tempera- 
ture 99Â° this morning, 100Â° last night. 

The pulse is now 60 to 100, changing its rate quickly and frequently. 
Respiration easy. The mind seems clear, but she is very disinclined 
to talk or make any effort. 

The glands in the right side of the neck are slightly enlarged. The 
heart is negative. No rales are detected over the fronts. The backs 
are not examined as it does not seem wise to disturb her to that extent. 
Abdominal examination gives negative results. The reflexes, super- 
ficial and deep, are not obtained. Urine negative. Neither the sputum 
nor the blood have been examined. There is no paralysis. 

1. What can be inferred from the effect of the morphia here? That the headache 

waa of an intensity rarely if ever eeen except in organic brain diaeaae. 

2. Significance of the way the headache came on? The circumstances proliably 

had nothing to do with it. The suddenness of onset is not characteristic ot 
any Nngle diaeaae. 

3. In what diseaeefl do the pupils give the most important information? Tabes 

dorsalis, general paralysis, old iritie, morphia poisoning, aneurism of the 

4. What cervical tumon are commonest? Adenitis (tuberculous or septic), Hodg- 

kins disease, kucemia, cervical rib, branchial cysts, cancer, and sarcoma. 

5. What help could be gained by examination of the blood and ^uta in this case? 

Normal blood would speak against meningitis, though in some tuberculous 
cases leucocj'tosis is alisent. The presence or absence of malarial psraaitÂ«s is 
important, as malaria may cause marked cerebral symptoms. If the Widal 
reaction wera absent and no basophilic stippling of the corpuscles present, 
we should have evidence against typhoid and against lead encephalopathy 
respectively. Sputmn examination would help to settle the question of tu- 
berculosis. 

6. What other exammations should be made? Spinal puncture, Kemig's sign, 

Babinski's reaction, retinal examination. 

7. Diagnosis? Prognows? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The mtensity of headache with photophobia and vomiting point 
to organic brain disease. The onset is more sudden than in most bnun dis- 
eases, except meningitis. The family history of phthisis, the recent cervical 
adenitis, and apical bronchitis with fever suggest tuberculous meningitis. 
Lumbar pmicture and retinal examination would settle it. 

All the symptoms here mentioned have occurred in brain tumor or abscess, 
but in most cases of these diseases, focal ^mptoms are present (paralyma, 
aphasia, Jacksonian epilepsy, local paresthesia, astereognoÂ«s) and the onset 
is slower. In malaria there is almost invariably more i^rexia, and in lead 
encephalopathy there are usually convulaons and evidences of lead in other 
organs. 

Meninpsmus at the onset of some infectious disease (typhoid, pneumonia) is 
unlikely, on account of the severity of the headache, the moderate tempera- 
ture, and the absence of positive evidence of any such infection. Tuberculous 
meningitb â that is, acute general tuberculo^ with predominance of menin- 
geal symptoms â seems the most prolDable diagnoffls. 

Prognosis: Recovery is barely posuble, perhaps once in one thousand cases. 
Death will probably occur within two weeks. 

Treatment; Lumbar puncture sometimes relieves headache as well as helps 
diagnosis. (What would be found?) Otherwise the prevention of Ijed-sores, 
the alleviation of ^mptoms, and the support of the patient's strength is 
all we have to work for." 
"CASE 71 

A coachman of 45, of a very neurotic family, has had dyspepsia for 
fifteen years. Any worry or excitement brings on distress and sour 
eructations. Three years ago had ""spinal meningitis""; since then 
never well in mind or body. Forgetful and bewildered, up to the last 
two months, when he became much clearer and has since devoted him- 
self to his health. Two spots, one over the left kidney and one on the 
top of his skull, feel hot to him. Also numbness on the left leg, less 
noticed when he is busy. Left hand always colder than the right. 

Since the fever three years ago his dyspepsia has been worse. Almost 
any food distresses him after a time. More than one half a cupful of 
any liquid causes vomiting, and despite care he vomits very frequently. 
No blood or brown stuff in vomitus, which consists of food and slime. 

Pain and tenderness in the epigastrium are almost incessant. Appe- 
tite excellent, bowels always costive, sleeps poorly. 

Examination: Rather thin, good color, tongue protruded very far. 
In epigastrium, a resistance uneven, soft and doughy in feel, dull on 
percussion and very tender. The lower border of it is well defined, 
especially on the left. At times, movements, apparently peristaltic, 
can be felt there. Visceral examination is otherwise negative 

The stomach tube was passed and abundant free hydrochloric acid 
found, but the ingestion of over 6 ounces of liquid caused the patient 
great pain, which lasted for two hours after the tube was removed. 

The patient was constantly expectorating saliva, and stated that 
milk always poisoned him, and that the only food that agreed with him 
is wild game. A partridge was procured for him, but he had a bad 
night after it, because, as he said, he tasted some of the shot with 
which the partridge had been killed. He remained in the hospital from 
November 1 to November 11, 1892, and then left unimproved. 

Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The first paragraph and the last two point strongly to a gastric 
neuro^, and this diagnosis still stands on the hospital record book to-day. 
Against this, however, are the small capacity of the stomach (six ovinces causes 
great pain and often vomiting), the peristaltic movements in the epigastrium, 
â  and the other physical Â«gns at that point. A contracted stomach with pyloric 
obetruction and abundant free HCI is a veiy unusual combmation, but to 
that the signs point. At autopsy (three months later) exactly this com- 
bination waÂ£ found. The gastric wall waÂ£ from one half to three quarters 
of an inch thick, the capacity alxiut seven ounces, the scar of a large ulcer 
near the pylorus and great thickening and stenosis of the latter. The case 
is very important because both neurasthenia and organic disease were present, 
and the neurasthenic aspects altogether blinded us to the test. 

PrognoMS and Treatment: An operation should of course have been done, and 
with this the patient might well have recovered within a few months." 
"CASE 72 

A single man, 37, in business, six feet two inches tall, weighing 246, 
states that several members of his family have had heart disease, one 
dying suddenly. He is seen March 3, 1903. He denies lues, but has 
had five or six attacks of clap, the last three months ago. Coitus is not 
very frequent. He drank freely until three years ago when he had 
phlebitis in the left leg. At this time he weighed 200, was treated at 
Aix-les-Bains, lost 30 lbs., and felt better for it. Since then he has 
taken three or four whiskies a day. A year ago he was under medical 
care for a short time with indefinite symptoms, the pulse never rising 
above 100. Last summer he played 27 holes at golf without incon- 
venience. In October, 1902, he had business worries which kept him 
awake more or less for several weeks, and during this time he drank 
more freely again. He takes no regular exercise; is fat, flabby, and 
colorless. 

Four days ago he called in his physician for vague discomfort in the 
upper abdomen and irregular bowels. The heart's action was then 
regular in force and rhythm, varying in rate from 160-180, only count- 
able with the stethoscope over the apex. He sleeps with only one pillow, 
on either side, and has not been directly conscious of his heart, even on 
such exertion as is incidental to his life. In spite of absolute rest for 
four days, the heart continues rapid. Temperature normal; urine 
negative. He wishes to get up and attend to business. He does not 
seem, and saya he does not feel, nervous. The appetite and digestion 
are good enough; the tongue clean, the gums healthy. The heart-beats 
are quite regular, 160 per minute, counted with the stethoscope, and 
the rate does not vary whether he sits, stands, or lies down. The 
cardiac impulse is visible and palpable only when he lies on his left side; 
it can then be localized about an inch to the left of the nipple, in the 
fifth space. Percussion yields somewhat unsatisfactory results on 
account of the thickness of the chest wall, but dulness seems to extend 
slightly beyond the nipple as he lies on his back. The sounds are clear, 
save in the left lateral decubitus; in that position, a slight systolic 
murmur is audible at the apex. The lungs and abdomen are nega- 
tive. The superficial refiexes are absent; the knee-jerks slight. There 
is no tremor. There is slight oedema of the legs and a corded vein (?) 
can be felt in the left calf. He wears Boston garters. 

1, What form of alcoholic drink haa most often a demonstrable and permanent 

effect upon the heart? Beer. A hypertrophy and subsequent dUatation often 
occurs. Whiskey usually produces only temporary weakness. 

2. What inference is suggested by the absence of arhythmia in this case? Myo- 

cardial degeneration usually produces arhythmia. Any disturbance of car- 
nore serioua tban a dmiUr disturbance 

3. Among the methods of examination not yet employed in this case, which are 

likely and which unlikely to yield valuable information? We should aecer- 
tain whether the eyes are prominent or the thyroid are enlarged. These 
data will help to decide for or against one cause of tachycardia â namely. 
Graves' disease. The urine should be examined. It it showed the evidences 
of chronic nephritis the heart symptoms might be thus explainable. It 
would be valuable to know how his heart reacts to exertion. Organic heart 
weakness is usually increased by slight exertion, while ""functional"" weak- 
ness is often lessened. If the ""clap"" is healed, involvement of the heart in 
this infection becomes unhkely. Blood-pressure measurements, if normal, 
would be reassuring. If he uses tobacco to excess the symptoms may be 
due to this cause. Blood examination would probably yield no important 
information. 

4. Has the venereal histoiy any relation to the present symptoms? Probably not. 

Gonorrhieal endocarditis or myocarditis produce fever and more definite 
evidences of valvular deformity; further, his gonorrhoea is apparently healed. 
6. Causes and types of tachycardia? Any physical or emotional activity, many 
infectious diseases and toxic states, cardiac weakness and dilatation from 
any cause, Graves' disease, ""paroxysmal tachycardia."" 
6. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnoms: There was no exophthalmos or goitre; the urine was normal; tobacco 
was used to excess; the gonorrhoea was healed; blood pressure was normal 
and was increased (not decreased) by exertion. It should be noted that 
the position of the palpable apex beat was normal /or the position in which 
the patient lay. The attack is too long to be classed as ""paroxysmal"" tachy- 
cardia. There is no good evidence of infection or of cardiac dilatation. A 
Bubiestive ""sense of well-being"" such as is here present is not often seen in 
orgrinic heart lesions with tachycardia. 

There is no evidence of passive congestion anywhere, for in a fat man slight 
(Ediima of the legs is physiological, especially with varicose veins such as 
appear to be hure present. Hence we have no considerable heart weakness. 
Tcxic extra-sysi'.oies, due to the effect of an excess of tobacco (and perhaps 
alcohol) on an otherwise healthy heart, seems the probable cause of thfe tachy- 
cardia in this case. 

Prognosis: Such ""functional"" upsets of a healthy heart are usually over within 
a few weeks. The failure of the heart to slow down under rest is surprising 
but need not discourage us. 

Treatment: Possibly he -is being kept too quiet. If his heart's power is fair 
(as it seems to be) he will t>e the t>etlÂ«r for using it a little. This will ease 
the psychical tension and probably slow the heart. The omission of all 
tobacco and alcohol and the lapse of time are the moat important means of 
cuie, but Nauheim baths and motions (carried out at home) will hasten 
recovery."
"CASE 73 

July 20, 1905, a girl of 16, previously healthy, was attacked in the 
mormng by paiu in the sternum with a sense of pressure. Later the 
pain extended round the chest and became severe on any movement 
of the intercostal muscles â ao that breathing was painful and shallow. 
She felt feverish and nauseated, and in the evening her temperature 
rose to 101Â°. She slept fairly well and next day her fever was gone 
and she waa almost well; walked, drove, and ate her meals with good 
appetite. On the third day the pain and fever returned and both were 
worse than before; the pain extended round both sides of the chest, 
from the armpit to the bottom of the ribs, and also into both shoulders. 
In the evening the temperature was 103Â°. Next day she remained in 
bed feeling greatly improved, but still somewhat sore and achey. 

On the fifth day the pain came three or four hours earlier than in 
the previous attack, and was agonizing in character. The temperature 
reached 104Â° in the evening. 

There was no chill, no sweating, and no cough at any time. Visceral 
examination was negative â also the urine. The blood was not exam- 
ined. Calomel was .given on the fourth day, without relief. 

1. (a) Causes of severe thoracic pain? (b) Of mild thoracic paint (a) Pteuri^ 

(pneumonic, tuberculous, or ""simple""), angina pectoris (organic or func- 
tional), intercoBtal neuraJ^a, muscular pain (""pleurodynia""), spondylitis 
(nerve-root pains), trichiniaeis, aneurism, (b) Infectious diseases, fatigue. 

2. By what additional data could diagnosis be made easier here? A careful his- 

tory with special reference to a possible source of infection; a, thorough ex- 
amination of the Uood and of the spleen. 

3. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Paroxysms of fever recurring every second day with complete 
apyrexia on the intervening days, almost never occurs except in malaria. 
Pyogenic infections (including advanced phthisis) may in rarÂ« cases produce 
. such a fever curve, but in these conditions the patient is never as well on 
the intervening days as this patient was, and usually shows well-marked local 
lesions of some kind. The pains of this case are very unusual for malaria 
but not unknown, and it is a safe' rule to assume, until it is proved to the con- 
trary, that any symptoms that recur every forty-eight hours, with fever, and 
disappear completely on the intervening days, leaving no physical signs of 
disease, are due to malaria. The blood was not examined in thb case 
until after quinine had been given with complete and permanent relief of 
all symptoms. After this no parasites were found in the blood. Abdomin^ 
pain is not infrequently the only striking symptom of malaria, but thoracic 
pain is rare. 

Prognosis; Every case of tÂ«rtian malaria can be completely arrested in a few 
days by quinine. Cases resisting quinine for a week are not tertian malaria 
â the only form seen in the northern part of this country. 

Treatment: Morphia subcutaneously for pain, fever, or chill. Quinine gr. V 
t.i.d. in capsule or solution for three days. Then gr. IH t.i.d. for a week." 
"CASE 74 

A lithuanian teamster, 48, entered the hospital, April 22, 1904, 
with the following history: Parents died of old age. He uses thirty- 
five cents' worth of tobacco a week, alcohol occasionally. He ha^ 
always been well until April 15, when he went to work feeling all right. 
In the afternoon his neck began to pain him, he was chilly, then felt hot, 
and sweat a good deal, later his neck began to swell and became more 
painful. His throat was sore, dry, and painful on swallowing. Two 
days later he started to work, but had to give up and came to the hos- 
pital. 

Physical examination showed a well-nourished man with slight 
prostration. Slight conjunctivitis. Tongue protruded in median line. 
Throat dry, red, with considerable dirty secretion on the walls of the 
pharynx. Slight cyaaoeia of the face and fingeivtips. Neck short, 
thick, and reddened at the base with brawny induration. Redness 
and induration extends down over the upper part of the chest. Tender- 
ness and swelling at the posterior edge of the sterno-cleido-mastoid 
muscle at either side. 

Inspection shows no enlargement of the veins of the upper chest or 
of the arms. Percussion of the chest shows dulness over manubrium, 
extending one finger's breadth on either side. Lungs are appar- 
ently normal. Heart's apex in fifth interspace nipple line. Right 
border at right sternal edge. Sounds distant, no murmurs heard. 
Pulse 120, regular, fair volume and tension. Abdomen full, tympanitic, 
not tender, liver and spleen not enlaiged. Knee-jerks present, no 
paralysis, no Kemig, no oedema, no general glandular enlaigemeat. 
Blood showed red cells 5,001,800, white cells 21,700, Hffimoglobin 90%. 
Differential count of 200 leucocytes showed: Polynuclears 78%,, lym- 
phocytes 22%, eosinophiles 0. Urine normal, acid, sp. gr. 1021, 
albumen slight trace, chlorides diminished. Sediment: numerous 
hyaline and fine granular casts, with occasional cells adherent. Occa- 
sional free mononuclear cells, rare blood corpuscle. Temperature 101.4Â°, 
respiration 25. 

April 24. Delirium for past two days requiring restraint. Quieter 
this morning. Throat somewhat cleaner, less cyanosis and tenderness 
in neck. Otherwise physical examination unchanged. 

May 1. Temperature has ranged from 101.4Â° to 99.5Â° to-day. Pulse 
from 120 to 100, respiration from 25 at entrance to 35 to-day. 

May 2. Tumor at side of neck apparently increasing in size. Some 
cedema over the neck, and the small veins of that region more promi- 
nent. Bronchial breathing, over the right infrascapular region, with 
a few rales just below the angle of the scapular. Some cough and 
frothy sputum. Laiyngoscopic report: ""No cedema or paralysis of re- 
current laiyngeal, but some pressure oedema of left ary-epiglottic fold."" 
May 6. Considerable cough and expectoration. Some abdominal 
pain; has lost considerable weight. Fever lower; cervical tumor de- 
creasing. 

1. Causes of aubBtemal percusnon dulness? Aneurism, enlarged bionchiat glands 

(tuberculosis, pseudoleucKmia, sepsis, cancer, sarcoma), tumors of the thy- 
roid or thymus gland, mediastinal abecess. 

2. Significance of the lack of eodnophiles here? Eoeinophiles may disappear in 

a severe type of any infection which causes leucocytosis, occasionBlly in 
toxic conditions associated with leucocytosis, and in some seven anpmina 
Their reappearance is always a favorable sign. 

3. How is the patient's delirium to be accounted for? Any severe infection may 

produce delirium, thou^ menin^tis and pneumonia most often do so. 

4. Of what diagnostic value is the fact that Kemig's sign is absent? Kemig's 
* sign is usually present in meningitis of any type. Its absence, therefore, 

tends to exclude meningitis. 

5. What further facts are needed for diagnosis in this case? The sputum should 

be examined for tubercle bacilli. No other data are essential, but a Widal 
reaction mi^t help to exclude typhoid, and a spinal puncture to exclude 
meningitis. 
S. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The physical signs of disease are chiefly in the neck and upper thoracic 
re^on. Tuberculous of the lung, meninges, and cervical glands wouM account 
foe some of the signs, but would not be likely to produce so much pain and 
local oedema. The sputa were negative for tubercle bacilli on repeated ex- 
amination. Venous thromboMS would not explain the inflammatory reaction 
in the neck and would cause more oedema and mote enlargement of the super- 
ficial veins. The same evidence is valid against mediastinal new growth or 
abscees. Deep-seated inflammation in the neck (with or without pus) is 
the most defensible diagnosis, â Ludwig's an^na. The Widal reaction 
was negative. 

Prognosis: The cases usually run a severe course, and unless pus can be located 
and removed are often fatal within a fortnight. In tbis case, however, defer- 
vescence and improvement of all symptoms went on slowly but steadily after 
May 6, and in a few weeks he was well â substantially without interference 
other than good nursing. 

Treatment: To find and remove pus when it is present, and to support the 
patient's strength, ate the main indications."
"CASE 75 

Mrs. M., 51, is seen August 9, 1905, She haa been in bed since 
July 4, suffering from ""a complication of diseases,"" aad her medical 
attendant has been changed several times. 

She had nervous prostration fourteen years ago, and has never been 
well since, but except for children's diseases she has had no other definite 
illness. She has had eight children â the laat six years ago â and, 
until recently, has done most of the housework for the whole family. 

Her present illness began July 4 with diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, and 
sweating. These symptoms passed off in about three weeks, but there 
have been suggestions of a return of them several times, and she has not 
regained her full strength. Insomnia is a very troublesome symptom, 
and in the long, wakeful hours she sometimes has spells of ""weak- 
ness,"" for which aromatic spirits of ammonia is taken with some relief. 
There are also ""smothering spells"" when she feels as if she must get up 
and walk, and is restrained only by the strict orders of her physician. 

She has never been a hearty eater, but the appetite is now very fair. 
There is no pain and the bowels move with the aid of laxatives. 

Examination showed a stout, pale woman, with a temperature of 
99Â°. The size of the heart could not be exactly determined on account 
of fat, but the sounds were normal and were loudest in their normal 
sites. The peripheral arteries were normal. At the beginning of the 
examination Ene crackles were heard at the base of each axilla, but they 
disappeared after a few deep breaths and were not heard again. Liver 
dulness begins at the seventh rib, and the edge can be felt below the 
ribs. Otherwise visceral examination is negative. Hsemoglobin 90%. 
Urine normal. 
Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: A feverish gastro-Â«atÂ«ritia five weeks ago; now weakness, insomnia, 
and smothering spells, with a desire to move about â such are the main com- 
plaints. In a woman of 51 these symptoms suggest arterio-scleioeiB or myo- 
carditis, but the physical examination ^vea no Eupport to these diagnoses, 
and without physical signs one cannot make them. The crackles in the 
lungs would have been significant had they persisted, but transietU crackles 
at base of the axilla have no pathological significance. The liver is low â 
both the upper and the lower border- â but sSiowa no evidence of enlarge- 
ment, and simple ptosis, whether of the liver or of all the abdominal organs, 
is not likely to explain the symptoms of this case. The main question is: 
Has the woman any disease at all? Are not her weakness and insomnia the 
result of staying in bed? This diagnosis was in fact verified by the results 
of getting up and to work. In a few weeks tie woman was perfectly well. 
Prognosis and Treatment: The reassurance that one can give after convincing 
himself by a thorough examination that the organs are sound is the most 
important medicine for such a caae. The stimulus of work and exercise, 
with the increased appetite and sleep resulting, will usually complete the cure." 
"CASE 76 

Mr. v., a theatre usher of 47, unmanied, lost his voice six months 
ago. Since then it has gradually improved, until now he epeaka quite ' 
audibly. Otherwise he has been well and worked steadily and hard, â 
though occasionally he has felt an ache between his shoulders for one 
half a day or so. On one occasion, three months ago, this pain occurred 
while he was walking and almost took his breath away for a few minutes. 
Since this time there has been no pain. Insomnia has troubled him for 
many years, and he gets little sleep after 4 a.m. He admits that he 
is of nervous temperament, and has been considerably worried. There 
has been no cough, no emaciation, and, so far as he knows, no fever. 
Appetite good, bowels regular. His regular weight is 158. 

Examination shows a healthy-looking man with no fever. Weight 
160. The heart's apex in the fifth space, three-quarters of an inch out- 
side the nipple. The heart sounds are clear â the aortic second loud, 
low-pitched, and easily palpable. The pupils are equal and react nor- 
mally. The pulses equal and synchronous. Brachials slightly tor- 
tuous and have a lateral excursion. No thrill or abnormal dulness in 
the front of the chest. 

At the left apex behind, there is dulness, increased voice and fremi- 
tus, and whistling breathing (stridor). In the right side of the neck is 
a mass the size of a goose's egg ; its lower portion is hard and seems 
connected with the clavicle. Above, it pulsates strongly. The whole is 
smooth and not tender. Laryngoscopic examination shows the left 
vocal cord in the cadaveric position. The blood and urine are normal 
and visceral examination is negative, except for the deviations noted. 

1. Causes of accentuated aortic eecond sound? Increased peripheral resistance 

due to artetio-ficlerosis, nephritis with hi^ tension pulse, severe muscular 
exertion, aneuriam. 

2. Causes of hoaraeoeas or aphonia? Laryngitia (""simple"" or tuberculous), syphilis, 

laryngeal tumors, paralyais of a vocal cord or partial paralysis of both, hysteria. 

3. What is the cervical tumor? It was at first diagnosed as aneurism (of the carotid 

or subclavian), but proved to be a cervical rib crossed by the subcbvian. 

4. Diagnosis? Prognosia? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: The important signs are: paralysis of the left vocal cord, arterio- 
Bclerosis with resulting cardiac hypertrophy, solidification and stridor at the 
apex of the left lung. An X-ray plate of the chest showed a large aneurism 
of the aortic arch. The puzzling things in the case were (a) the pulsating 
tumor in the right neck, which one tried naturally but unsuccessfully to asso- 
ciate with the paralysis of the kft vocal cord, and (b) the absence of any signs 
of aneurism except the paralyzed vocal cord. 

Prognosis: Most cases of aoH,ic sjieurism progress and kill, despite treatment, 
witiin two years. A few remain quiescent or even whoUy latÂ«nt tor many 

Treatment: Several weeks of rest in bed with light diet and KI gr. x-xx t.i.d. 
serves to improve the symptoms and lengthen the course of some cases." 
"CASE 77 

Called to see a young girl of 21, eingle, who is said to have had, 
twelve hours before, a large pulmonary iuemorrhage, â a pint, after a 
tew days' cough. Previously well, but nervous; easily startled and 
frequently troubled with food ""going the wrong way,"" and causing 
symptoms of temporary spasm of the glottis. 

When seen, could only speak in a whisper; throat examination was 
impossible on account of gagging. Lungs entirely negative, except 
slight dulness and prolonged expiration at right apex. Heart some- 
what rapid; systolic murmur at base of the heart, loudest in pulmonary 
area. At the root of the neck, in front, a swelling size of a hen's egg, 
smooth, soft, not tender. Abdomen negative. Face very pale, lips 
less so. Slight cedema of ankles. 

Urine pale, acid 1018; albumen, slightest possible trace; 1% of 
sugar; amount, 2^ quarts. Sediment, mostly squamous and neck of 
bladder cells. Few small hyaline casts. 

Blood: Reds 4,800,000; whites 10,000; Hg. 60%. 

1. Wliat further information is needed about the bEemorrhage here? Did any one 

Bee the blood come up? She may be a maljn gergr. Was the blood mixed 
with air or food? 

2. If hemorrhage were due in this case to phthisis, what physical signs should one 

expect to find twelve hours after? None. The earliest physical signs usually 
appear months later. 

3. What else may cause such hemorrhage? Gastric ulcer, esophageal varices in 

cirrhosis, leaking aneurism. 

4. How is the cedema of the ankles to be accounted for? Probably ansmia; pos- 

sibly nephritb. 

5. What other causes of (Edema can you name? Cardiac weakness, obesity, neuri- 

tis, thrombosis, varicose veins, or other local causes of venous obstruction. 

6. Significance of the lung signs in this case? They are within physiological limits. 

7. By what further methods of examination could their significance t>e more defi- 

nitely determined? Sputum examination after administration of KI. Tem- 
perature records, tuberculin leaction, 

8. Name three causes of systolic murmurs loudest in the pulmonary area. "" Func- 

tional"" changes, aneurism, pulmonary stenosis. 

9. Can the neck tumor be connected in any way with the glottic spasm? Why 

or why not? No, because the tumor is too small and too far from the glottis. 

10. From the data given about the blood, what should one expect to find in the 

stained blood-film? Small, pale red cells, not otherwise abnormal. Normal 
leucocyte percentages. 

11. What conclusions should be drawn from the urine in this case? None that 

aie definite. The causes of the albuminuria and of the glycosuria should be 
sought. 

12. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

Diagnosis: Goitre and tachycardia suggest Graves' disease. We do not know 
whether or not the eyes protruded or whether there was tremor. Pulmonary 
bleedingi, gJ^cOBUna, albuminuria, aod amemia have repeatedly occurred 
without known cause in Graves' diaeaae. FbthiatB and malin^ring must be 
excluded by the methods suggested under questions one and seven. Aneurism 
cauaee aphonia and (if it leaka) bleeding. There are none of the other physical 
signs of aneurism in this case, but an X-ray may be needed to exclude it. 
The glottic spasm and aphonia occur in many neuroses and are characteristic 
of none. Exophthalmic goitre turned out the true diagnosis, other alterna- 
tives being excluded. 

Pn^nows: Moat cases last for yeais; many get well of themselves; some are 
never discovered (""jormea frudes""). Relapses are common. Cardiac dila- 
tation and diarrhcea may kill after an acute or chronic course. 

Treatment: Hypenic and supportive, with encouragement. Drugs are prob- 
ab^ useless. A thyro-lytio serum has recently been prepared and apparently 
does good. , ,"
"CASE 78 

Fireman, 57 years old, had scarlet fever at 9 years, apparently 
without ill results. Otherwise he has been always well till six months 
ago, when on a vacation he ate some canned oysters in the form of a 
stew. One half hour afterwards breath was suddenly shut off. No 
pain, vomiting, or other symptoms. Troubled with respiration ever 
since when in midst of fire smoke. Lost 30 lbs, in three months. Four 
weeks ago, when turning in bed, noticed a swelling in the left loin which 
seemed to move with change of position. No pain or tenderness and 
no change in urine. 

Examination: On left side two tumors are felt below the ribs; one 
above and in front feels like a spleen. The other is more rounded and 
deeper. Both move with respiration. The lower tumor is somewhat 
tender and apparently elastic. Belly otherwise negative. Lungs nega- 
tive. Heart not remarkable except for a loud ringing aortic second 
sound. Brachials tortuous and move laterally. Urine 1018, 40 oz. in 
twenty-four hours. Slight trace of albumen. Few hyaline and fine 
granular casts, some with cells or fat on them. Blood normal, no fever. 

1. What are the common causes for the appearance of sli^t dyepncea in a man of 

57? Arterio-BcleroBis and its remilte, emphfBema, obeaitir. 

2. What was the action of the canned oyetersT Possibly dyspeptic flatulence, 

embarrassed cardiac action by direct pressure throu^ the diaphragm. Prob- 
ably, however, the aasociation was accidental. 

3. (a) What abdominal tumors move most freely with respiration? (6) What least 

freely? (a) Those connected with the liver, stomach, and spleen; (b) those 
connected with the kidney and pancreas, 

4. Enumerate some of the conditions in which such a urine is often seen? In 

pssMve congestion, fevera and after exertion, when'there is bile or sugar in 
the urine, in arterio-sclenMis and chronic interstitial nephritis, 
fi. What imporlAnt and simple methods of examination have been omitted? In- 
flation of the colon, palpation in a warm bath. 

6. What questions ^ould be asked with reference to the loss of weight? Have 

t^tpetite and sleep been as good as usualT 

7. Diagnosis? Prognosis? Treatment? 

DiagnoÂ»s: An abdominal tumor, painless, slow growing, and producing little 
or no disturbance of any function, is the chief feature of the case. The tumor 
occupies more nearly the position of the left kidney than of any other organ. 
It is rounded and elastic. Renal abscess, cyst, or hjrdronepbroHis suggest 
themselves. The absence of fever, pyuria, leucocytosis, and pain are against 
abscess, and the absence of any pain or disturbance of micturition make hy- 
dronephrosis unlikely. The inflated colon traverses the tumor. At opera- 
tion a congenital cystic kidney weighing S70 grams was found and removed. 
The djrspnixa, however, continued, and a year latflr autopsy showed general 
arterio-sclerosis with cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, general passive 
congestion and terminal streptococcus sepsis. 

Prognosis and Treatment are sufficiently suggested in what has been said."
